Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, \"domainless\" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                <tr class=\"technique\">\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1219\"> T1219 </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1219\"> Remote Access Software </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                                An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.

This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. <a href=\"/techniques/T1205/001\">Port Knocking</a>), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.

Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n            <!--stop-indexing-for-search-->\n            <!-- search overlay for entire page -- not displayed inline -->\n            <div class=\"overlay search\" id=\"search-overlay\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <div class=\"overlay-inner\">\n        <!-- text input for searching -->\n        <div class=\"search-header\">\n            <div class=\"search-input\">\n                <input type=\"text\" id=\"search-input\" placeholder=\"search\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"search-icons\">\n                <div class=\"search-parsing-icon spinner-border\" style=\"\" id=\"search-parsing-icon\"></div>\n                <div class=\"close-search-icon\" id=\"close-search-icon\">\u00d7</div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- results and controls for loading more results -->\n        <div id=\"search-body\" class=\"search-body\">\n            <div class=\"results\" id=\"search-results\">\n                <!-- content will be appended here on search -->\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"load-more-results\" class=\"load-more-results\">\n                <button class=\"btn btn-default\" id=\"load-more-results-button\">load more results</button>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"row flex-grow-0 flex-shrink-1\">\n            <!-- footer elements -->\n            <footer class=\"col footer\">\n                <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                    <div class=\"row row-footer\">\n                        <div class=\"col-2 col-sm-2 col-md-2\">\n                            <div class=\"footer-center-responsive my-auto\">\n                                <a href=\"https://www.mitre.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"MITRE\">\n                                    <img src=\"/theme/images/mitrelogowhiteontrans.gif\" class=\"mitre-logo-wtrans\">\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"col-2 col-sm-2 footer-responsive-break\"></div>\n                        <div class=\"footer-link-group\">\n                            <div class=\"row row-footer\">\n                                <div class=\"px-3 col-footer\">\n                                    <u class=\"footer-link\"><a href=\"/resources/engage-with-attack/contact\" class=\"footer-link\">Contact Us</a></u>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"px-3 col-footer\">\n                                    <u class=\"footer-link\"><a href=\"/resources/legal-and-branding/terms-of-use\" class=\"footer-link\">Terms of Use</a></u>\n                                </div>\n                                    <div class=\"px-3 col-footer\">\n                                        <u class=\"footer-link\"><a href=\"/resources/legal-and-branding/privacy\" class=\"footer-link\">Privacy Policy</a></u>\n                                    </div>\n                                <div class=\"px-3\">\n                                    <u class=\"footer-link\"><a href=\"/resources/changelog.html\" class=\"footer-link\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" data-html=\"true\" title=\"\" data-original-title=\"ATT&amp;CK content v15.1\nWebsite  v4.1.3\">Website Changelog</a></u>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"row\">\n                                <small class=\"px-3\">\n                                    \u00a9&nbsp;2015&nbsp;-&nbsp;2024, The MITRE Corporation.

This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1090/004\"> .004 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1090/004\"> Domain Fronting </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS.  Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, \"domainless\" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                <tr class=\"technique\">\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1219\"> T1219 </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1219\"> Remote Access Software </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                                An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.

Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. <a href=\"/techniques/T1205/001\">Port Knocking</a>), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.\n\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1205/001\"> .001 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1205/001\"> Port Knocking </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control.

The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                <tr class=\"technique\">\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1102\"> T1102 </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1102\"> Web Service </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                                Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system.
