Adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.\n\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1587/001\"> .001 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1587/001\"> Malware </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting.

Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.

To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed (<a href=\"/techniques/T1587\">Develop Capabilities</a>) or obtained (<a href=\"/techniques/T1588\">Obtain Capabilities</a>) and stage them on infrastructure under their control. These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary (<a href=\"/techniques/T1583\">Acquire Infrastructure</a>) or was otherwise compromised by them (<a href=\"/techniques/T1584\">Compromise Infrastructure</a>). Capabilities may also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin, or on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.\n\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1608/001\"> .001 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1608/001\"> Upload Malware </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.

Digital certificates include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct.

In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as <a href=\"/techniques/T1550/001\">Application Access Token</a>. Prior to <a href=\"/techniques/T1189\">Drive-by Compromise</a>, adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site.

Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser.
