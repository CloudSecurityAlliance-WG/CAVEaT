If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from <a href=\"/techniques/T1497\">Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion</a> during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1497/003\"> .003 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1497/003\"> Time Based Evasion </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
