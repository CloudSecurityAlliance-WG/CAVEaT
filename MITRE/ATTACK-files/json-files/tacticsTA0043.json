operations.</p><p>Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Such information may include details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute Initial Access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts.</p>\n\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n                                <div class=\"card\">\n                                    <div class=\"card-body\">\n                                        <div class=\"card-data\"><span class=\"h5 card-title\">ID:</span> TA0043</div>    \n                                            <div class=\"card-data\"><span class=\"h5 card-title\">Created:&nbsp;</span>02 October 2020</div>\n                                            <div class=\"card-data\"><span class=\"h5 card-title\">Last Modified:&nbsp;</span>18 October 2020</div>\n              \n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                    <div class=\"text-center pt-2 version-button live\">\n    <div class=\"live\">\n        <a data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"\" href=\"/versions/v15/tactics/TA0043/\" data-test-ignore=\"true\" data-original-title=\"Permalink to this version of TA0043\">Version Permalink</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"permalink\">\n        <a data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"\" href=\"/versions/v15/tactics/TA0043/\" data-test-ignore=\"true\" data-original-title=\"Go to the live version of TA0043\">Live Version</a><!--do not change this line without also changing versions.py-->\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <h2 class=\"pt-3\" id=\"techniques\">Techniques</h2><h6 class=\"table-object-count\">Techniques: 10</h6>\n                        <table class=\"table-techniques\">\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <td colspan=\"2\">ID</td>\n                <td>Name</td>\n                <td>Description</td>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n                <tr class=\"technique\">\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1595\"> T1595 </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1595\"> Active Scanning </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                                Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting.
