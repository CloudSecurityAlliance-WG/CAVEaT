Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0016 APT29 APT29 has created self-signed digital certiﬁcates to enable mutual TLS authentication for malware.
C0011 C0011 For C0011, Transparent Tribe established SSL certiﬁcates on the typo-squatted domains the group
registered.
G0056 PROMETHIUM PROMETHIUM has created self-signed digital certiﬁcates for use in HTTPS C2 traﬃc.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certiﬁcates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certiﬁcates are designed to instill trust.
They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has veriﬁed the
certiﬁcate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certiﬁcate trusts the signer, then they know they can
use that key to communicate with its owner. In the case of self-signing, digital certiﬁcates will lack the element of trust associated with the
signature of a third-party certiﬁcate authority (CA).
Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certiﬁcates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traﬃc (ex:
Asymmetric Cryptography with Web Protocols) or even enabling Adversary-in-the-Middle if added to the root of trust (i.e. Install Root
Certiﬁcate).
After creating a digital certiﬁcate, an adversary may then install that certiﬁcate (see Install Digital Certiﬁcate) on infrastructure under their
control.Other sub-techniques of Develop Capabilities (4)

DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentConsider use of services that may aid in the tracking of certiﬁcates in use on sites across
the Internet. In some cases it may be possible to pivot on known pieces of certiﬁcate
information to uncover other adversary infrastructure.Detection efforts may be focused
on related behaviors, such as Web Protocols , Asymmetric Cryptography , and/or Install
Root Certiﬁcate .
