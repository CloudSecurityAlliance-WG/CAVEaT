Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.Adversaries may gather information about the victim's organization that can be used during targeting. Information about an organization
may include a variety of details, including the names of divisions/departments, speciﬁcs of business operations, as well as the roles and
responsibilities of key employees.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Information about an
organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned
Websites). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or
Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts), and/or initial
access (ex: Phishing or Trusted Relationship).Sub-techniques (4)
