Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has recruited target organization employees or contractors who provide credentials and approve an
associated MFA prompt, or install remote management software onto a corporate workstation, allowing
LAPSUS$ to take control of an authenticated system.An adversary may rely upon speciﬁc actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to
execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document ﬁle or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on
behavior from forms of Phishing.
While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary
places a ﬁle in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after Internal
Spearphishing.
Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as enabling Remote Access Software, allowing direct control of the system
to the adversary, or downloading and executing malware for User Execution. For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through
Phishing, vishing, or various forms of user interaction. Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spooﬁng and
promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing
malware or Remote Access Software.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent executable ﬁles from running
unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria and to prevent Oﬃce applications from creating
potentially malicious executable content by blocking malicious code from being written to disk. Note:
cloud-delivered protection must be enabled to use certain rules. 
M1038 Execution
PreventionApplication control may be able to prevent the running of executables masquerading as other ﬁles.
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionIf a link is being visited by a user, network intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and
remove malicious downloads can be used to block activity.
M1021 Restrict Web-
Based ContentIf a link is being visited by a user, block unknown or unused ﬁles in transit by default that should not be
downloaded or by policy from suspicious sites as a best practice to prevent some vectors, such as .scr,
.exe, .pif, .cpl, etc. Some download scanning devices can open and analyze compressed and encrypted
formats, such as zip and rar that may be used to conceal malicious ﬁles.
M1017 User Training Use user training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and
how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events.[3]3/22/24, 3:37 PM User Execution, Technique T1204 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
rely upon speciﬁc actions by a user in order to gain execution.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor the execution of and command-line arguments for applications that may be
used by an adversary to gain Initial Access that require user interaction. This includes
compression applications, such as those for zip ﬁles, that can be used to
Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information in payloads.
DS0032 Container Container
CreationMonitor for newly constructed containers that may use an existing, legitimate external
Web service to exﬁltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.
Container Start Monitor for the activation or invocation of a container (ex: docker start or docker restart)
DS0022 File File Creation Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and ﬁles that are downloaded
and executed on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can
potentially detect malicious events once the ﬁle is opened (such as a Microsoft Word
document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning powershell.exe).
DS0007 Image Image Creation Monitor for newly constructed image that may use an existing, legitimate external Web
service to exﬁltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.
DS0030 Instance Instance
CreationMonitor for newly constructed instances that may use an existing, legitimate external
Web service to exﬁltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.
Instance Start Monitor for the activation or invocation of an instance (ex: instance.start within GCP
Audit Logs)
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed web-based network connections that are sent to
malicious or suspicious destinations (e.g. destinations attributed to phishing
campaigns). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect
anomalous processes execution and command line arguments (e.g. monitor anomalies
in use of ﬁles that do not normally initiate network connections or unusual connections
initiated by regsvr32.exe, rundll.exe, .SCF, HTA, MSI, DLLs, or msiexec.exe).
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated with web-based
network connections that are sent to malicious or suspicious detinations (e.g.
destinations attributed to phishing campaigns). Consider correlation with process
monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command
line arguments (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally initiate
network connections or unusual connections initiated by regsvr32.exe, rundll.exe, .SCF,
HTA, MSI, DLLs, or msiexec.exe).
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may be used by an adversary to gain Initial
Access that require user interaction. This includes compression applications, such as
those for zip ﬁles, that can be used to Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information in
payloads.
