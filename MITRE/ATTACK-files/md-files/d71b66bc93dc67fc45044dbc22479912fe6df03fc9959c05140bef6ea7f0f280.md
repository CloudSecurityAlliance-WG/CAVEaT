https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/ 4/24Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the "run keys"
in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be executed under the
context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.
The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
Run keys may exist under multiple hives. The HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx is also
available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a
dependency. For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a "Depend" key with RunOnceEx: reg add
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d "C:\temp\evil[.]dll" 
Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual
user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in. The startup folder path for the
current user is C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup . The startup folder path for all users
is C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp .
The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
Programs listed in the load value of the registry key HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows run
automatically for the currently logged-on user.
By default, the multistring BootExecute value of the registry key HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager is
set to autocheck autochk \* . This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the ﬁle-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut
down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.
Adversaries can use these conﬁguration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.
Adversaries may also use Masquerading to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.Other sub-techniques of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (14)

Registry modiﬁcations are often essential in establishing persistence via known Windows
mechanisms. Many legitimate modiﬁcations are done graphically via regedit.exe or by using the
corresponding channels, or even calling the Registry APIs directly. The built-in utility reg.exe provides
a command-line interface to the registry, so that queries and modiﬁcations can be performed from a
shell, such as cmd.exe. When a user is responsible for these actions, the parent of cmd.exe will likely
be explorer.exe. Occasionally, power users and administrators write scripts that do this behavior as
well, but likely from a different process tree. These background scripts must be learned so they can be
tuned out accordingly.
Output DescriptionThe sequence of processes that resulted in reg.exe being started from a shell. That
is, a hierarchy that looks like• great-grand\_parent.exe• grand\_parent.exe• parent.exe• reg.exe
