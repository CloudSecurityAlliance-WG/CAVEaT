DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to /proc ﬁles that may inject malicious code into processes via the
/proc ﬁlesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate
privileges. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases.Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc ﬁlesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
elevate privileges. Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc ﬁlesystem (/proc/[pid] ) then crafting a return-oriented
programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions. Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory
mappings. Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by
the /proc ﬁlesystem. This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the
program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout
randomization (ASLR). Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/[pid]/maps can be overwritten using dd.
Other techniques such as Dynamic Linker Hijacking may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets. Similar to
Process Hollowing, proc memory injection may target child processes (such as a backgrounded copy of sleep).
Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
elevated privileges. Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked
under a legitimate process.Other sub-techniques of Process Injection (12)
