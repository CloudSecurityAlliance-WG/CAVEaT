https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004/ 3/4Account Manipulation: SSH Authorized Keys
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0482 Bundlore Bundlore creates a new key pair with ssh-keygen and drops the newly created user key in authorized\_keys to
enable remote login.
G1006 Earth
LuscaEarth Lusca has dropped an SSH-authorized key in the /root/.ssh folder in order to access a compromised
server with SSH.
S0468 Skidmap Skidmap has the ability to add the public key of its handlers to the authorized\_keys ﬁle to maintain
persistence on an infected host.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has added RSA keys in authorized\_keys .
S0658 XCSSET XCSSET will create an ssh key if necessary with the ssh-keygen -t rsa -f $HOME/.ssh/id\_rsa -P
command. XCSSET will upload a private key ﬁle to the server to remotely access the host without a password.Adversaries may modify the SSH authorized\_keys ﬁle to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions and macOS commonly
use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The authorized\_keys ﬁle in
SSH speciﬁes the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the ﬁle is conﬁgured. This ﬁle is usually found in the
user's home directory under /.ssh/authorized\_keys . Users may edit the system’s SSH conﬁg ﬁle to modify the directives
PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value "yes" to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH conﬁg
ﬁle is usually located under /etc/ssh/sshd\_config .
Adversaries may modify SSH authorized\_keys ﬁles directly with scripts or shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public
keys. In cloud environments, adversaries may be able to modify the SSH authorized\_keys ﬁle of a particular virtual machine via the
command line interface or rest API. For example, by using the Google Cloud CLI’s "add-metadata" command an adversary may add SSH keys
to a user account. Similarly, in Azure, an adversary may update the authorized\_keys ﬁle of a virtual machine via a PATCH request to the
API. This ensures that an adversary possessing the corresponding private key may log in as an existing user via SSH. It may also lead
to privilege escalation where the virtual machine or instance has distinct permissions from the requesting user.
Where authorized\_keys ﬁles are modiﬁed via cloud APIs or command line interfaces, an adversary may achieve privilege escalation on the
target virtual machine if they add a key to a higher-privileged user.
SSH keys can also be added to accounts on network devices, such as with the ip ssh pubkey-chain Network Device CLI command.Other sub-techniques of Account Manipulation (6)

ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature
or ProgramDisable SSH if it is not necessary on a host or restrict SSH access for speciﬁc users/groups
using /etc/ssh/sshd\_config .
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsRestrict access to the authorized\_keys ﬁle.
M1018 User Account Management In cloud environments, ensure that only users who explicitly require the permissions to update
instance metadata or conﬁgurations can do so.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments to modify the authorized\_keys or
