Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1071 Rubeus Rubeus can reveal the credentials of accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled through AS-REP
roasting.Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by Password Cracking Kerberos messages.
Preauthentication offers protection against oﬄine Password Cracking. When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates
communication with the Domain Controller (DC) by sending an Authentication Server Request (AS-REQ) message with a timestamp that is
encrypted with the hash of their password. If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s
password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the user.
Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.
For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and
receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4. The recovered encrypted data
may be vulnerable to oﬄine Password Cracking attacks similarly to Kerberoasting and expose plaintext credentials. 
An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication
disabled by utilizing Windows tools like PowerShell with an LDAP ﬁlter. Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each
user. If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the
encrypted data. 
Cracked hashes may enable Persistence, Privilege Escalation, and Lateral Movement via access to Valid Accounts.Other sub-techniques of Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (4)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Kerberos preauthentication is enabled by default. Older protocols might not support preauthentication
therefore it is possible to have this setting disabled. Make sure that all accounts have preauthentication
whenever possible and audit changes to setting. Windows tools such as PowerShell may be used to easily
ﬁnd which accounts have preauthentication disabled. 
M1041 Encrypt
Sensitive
InformationEnable AES Kerberos encryption (or another stronger encryption algorithm), rather than RC4, where
possible.
M1027 Password
PoliciesEnsure strong password length (ideally 25+ characters) and complexity for service accounts and that
these passwords periodically expire. Also consider using Group Managed Service Accounts or another
third party product such as password vaulting. 
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active DirectoryActive Directory
Credential
RequestMonitor for anomalous activity, such as enabling Audit Kerberos Service Ticket
Operations to log Kerberos TGS service ticket requests. Particularly investigate
irregular patterns of activity (ex: accounts making numerous requests, Event ID 4768
and 4769, within a small time frame, especially if they also request RC4 encryption
[Type 0x17], pre-authentication not required [Type: 0x0]).
