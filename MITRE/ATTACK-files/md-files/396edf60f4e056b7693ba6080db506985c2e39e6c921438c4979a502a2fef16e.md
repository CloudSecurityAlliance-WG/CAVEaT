Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0677 AADInternals AADInternals can steal users’ access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.
G0007 APT28 APT28 has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications
masquerading as "Google Defender" "Google Email Protection," and "Google Scanner" for Gmail users. They
also targeted Yahoo users with applications masquerading as "Delivery Service" and "McAfee Email
Protection".
S0683 Peirates Peirates gathers Kubernetes service account tokens using a variety of techniques.Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.
Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to
access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS). OAuth is one commonly implemented
framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized
environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege
escalation and further compromise of the environment.
In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account
tokens. If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container’s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API
commands.
Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access. An application desiring
access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An example
commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant ﬂow. An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to
interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.
Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the
target user's OAuth token. The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example
Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls. Then, they
can send a Spearphishing Link to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application. Once the OAuth access token is granted,
the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through Application Access Token.
Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token. However, in
some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens, allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.[1]

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Administrators should audit all cloud and container accounts to ensure that they are necessary and that
the permissions granted to them are appropriate. Additionally, administrators should perform an audit of all
OAuth applications and the permissions they have been granted to access organizational data. This should
be done extensively on all applications in order to establish a baseline, followed up on with periodic audits
of new or updated applications. Suspicious applications should be investigated and removed.
M1021 Restrict Web-
Based ContentAdministrators can block end-user consent to OAuth applications, disabling users from authorizing third-
party apps through OAuth 2.0 and forcing administrative consent for all requests. They can also block end-
user registration of applications by their users, to reduce risk. A Cloud Access Security Broker can also be
used to ban applications.
Azure offers a couple of enterprise policy settings in the Azure Management Portal that may help:
"Users -> User settings -> App registrations: Users can register applications" can be set to "no" to prevent
users from registering new applications. "Enterprise applications -> User settings -> Enterprise applications:
Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf" can be set to "no" to prevent users
from consenting to allow third-party multi-tenant applications
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnforce role-based access control to limit accounts to the least privileges they require. A Cloud Access
Security Broker (CASB) can be used to set usage policies and manage user permissions on cloud
applications to prevent access to application access tokens. In Kubernetes applications, set
"automountServiceAccountToken: false" in the YAML speciﬁcation of pods that do not require access to
service account tokens.
M1017 User Training Users need to be trained to not authorize third-party applications they don’t recognize. The user should pay
particular attention to the redirect URL: if the URL is a misspelled or convoluted sequence of words related
to an expected service or SaaS application, the website is likely trying to spoof a legitimate service. Users
should also be cautious about the permissions they are granting to apps. For example, oﬄine access and
access to read emails should excite higher suspicions because adversaries can utilize SaaS APIs to
discover credentials and other sensitive communications.

ModiﬁcationAdministrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are
met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High
severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity
permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.Security analysts can hunt
for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource
provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can ﬁlter for apps that are authorized
by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions
incongruous with the app’s purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" ﬁelds. A speciﬁc app
can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed,
although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can
be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.Administrators can set up a
variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result
of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege
escalation actions such as role creations or policy modiﬁcations, which could be actions
performed after initial access.[12]3/22/24, 3:47 PM Steal Application Access Token, Technique T1528 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
