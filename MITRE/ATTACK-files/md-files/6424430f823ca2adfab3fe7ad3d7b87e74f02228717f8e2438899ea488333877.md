Adversaries may redirect network traﬃc to adversary-owned systems by spooﬁng Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) traﬃc and
acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect
network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable
follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniﬃng or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network conﬁguration settings from a DHCP
server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients. The typical server-client interaction is as follows:
1. The client broadcasts a DISCOVER message.
2. The server responds with an OFFER message, which includes an available network address.
3. The client broadcasts a REQUEST message, which includes the network address offered.
4. The server acknowledges with an ACK message and the client receives the network conﬁguration parameters.
Adversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network
conﬁgurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.
Through the malicious network conﬁgurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traﬃc through adversary-controlled
systems, and collect information from the client network.
DHCPv6 clients can receive network conﬁguration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a INFORMATION-REQUEST
(code 11) message to the All\_DHCP\_Relay\_Agents\_and\_Servers multicast address. Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to
respond to this request message with malicious network conﬁgurations.
Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spooﬁng to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, Service
Exhaustion Flood) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool.Other sub-techniques of Adversary-in-the-Middle (3)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003/ 4/4Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1037 Filter Network
TraﬃcConsider ﬁltering DHCP traﬃc on ports 67 and 68 to/from unknown or untrusted DHCP servers.
Additionally, port security may also be enabled on layer switches. Furthermore, consider enabling DHCP
snooping on layer 2 switches as it will prevent DHCP spooﬁng attacks and starvation attacks. Consider
tracking available IP addresses through a script or a tool.
Additionally, block DHCPv6 traﬃc and incoming router advertisements, especially if IPv6 is not commonly
used in the network.
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traﬃc patterns indicative of AiTM
activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor Windows logs (ex: EIDs 1341, 1342, 1020, and 1063) for changes to DHCP
settings. These may also highlight DHCP issues such as when IP allocations are low
or have run out.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor network traﬃc for suspicious/malicious behavior involving DHCP, such as
changes in DNS and/or gateway parameters. Additionally, monitor network traﬃc for
rogue DHCPv6 activity.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network traﬃc for anomalies associated with known AiTM behavior. Consider
monitoring for modiﬁcations to system conﬁguration ﬁles involved in shaping network
traﬃc ﬂow.
