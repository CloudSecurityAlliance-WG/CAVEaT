https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/ 3/6Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common
method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well
as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on ﬁle execution.
There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads. Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library ﬁles (DLLs) in a directory that
will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious
library when it is called for by the victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, by
placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously speciﬁed DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate
DLL. Often this location is the current working directory of the program. Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its
current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. 
Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a
redirection ﬁle) may cause a program to load a different DLL.
If a search order-vulnerable program is conﬁgured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also
be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or
from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program. Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally
because malicious DLLs may be conﬁgured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.Other sub-techniques of Hijack Execution Flow (12)

S0363 Empire Empire contains modules that can discover and exploit various DLL hijacking opportunities.
G0120 Evilnum Evilnum has used the malware variant, TerraTV, to load a malicious DLL placed in the TeamViewer
directory, instead of the original Windows DLL located in a system folder.
S0182 FinFisher A FinFisher variant uses DLL search order hijacking.
S0661 FoggyWeb FoggyWeb's loader has used DLL Search Order Hijacking to load malicious code instead of the
legitimate version.dll during the Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe execution
process.
S0009 Hikit Hikit has used DLL Search Order Hijacking to load oci.dll as a persistence mechanism.
S0070 HTTPBrowser HTTPBrowser abuses the Windows DLL load order by using a legitimate Symantec anti-virus binary,
VPDN\_LU.exe, to load a malicious DLL that mimics a legitimate Symantec DLL, navlu.dll.
S0260 InvisiMole InvisiMole can be launched by using DLL search order hijacking in which the wrapper DLL is placed in
the same folder as explorer.exe and loaded during startup into the Windows Explorer process instead
of the legitimate library.
S0530 Melcoz Melcoz can use DLL hijacking to bypass security controls.
G0045 menuPass menuPass has used DLL search order hijacking.

S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit contains a collection of Privesc-PowerUp modules that can discover and exploit DLL
hijacking opportunities in services and processes.
S0113 Prikormka Prikormka uses DLL search order hijacking for persistence by saving itself as ntshrui.dll to the
Windows directory so it will load before the legitimate ntshrui.dll saved in the System32 subdirectory.[9]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Use auditing tools capable of detecting DLL search order hijacking opportunities on systems within an
enterprise and correct them. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be
used to explore systems for DLL hijacking weaknesses.
Use the program sxstrace.exe that is included with Windows along with manual inspection to check
manifest ﬁles for side-by-side problems in software.
M1038 Execution
PreventionAdversaries may use new DLLs to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software
executed through search order hijacking by using application control solutions capable of blocking DLLs
loaded by legitimate software.
M1044 Restrict
Library
LoadingDisallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is available by
patch for XP+ and Server 2003+.
Enable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions (e.g.
%SYSTEMROOT% )to be used before local directory DLLs (e.g. a user's home directory)
The Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via Group Policy at Computer Conﬁguration > [Policies] >
Administrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode. The
associated Windows Registry key for this is located at
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode
