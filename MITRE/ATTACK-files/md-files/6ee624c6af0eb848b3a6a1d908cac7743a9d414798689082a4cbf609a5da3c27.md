ReferencesAdversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can
be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects. These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to.
Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.
Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a network. Depending on the access conﬁguration of the logon scripts, either
local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.Other sub-techniques of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts (5)
