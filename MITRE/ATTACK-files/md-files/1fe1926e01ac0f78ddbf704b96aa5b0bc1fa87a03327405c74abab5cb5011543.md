Entries
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0235 CrossRAT CrossRAT can use an XDG Autostart to establish persistence.
S0410 Fysbis If executing without root privileges, Fysbis adds a .desktop conﬁguration ﬁle to the user's
~/.config/autostart directory.
S0198 NETWIRE NETWIRE can use XDG Autostart Entries to establish persistence on Linux systems.
S0192 Pupy Pupy can use an XDG Autostart to establish persistence.
S1078 RotaJakiro When executing with user-level permissions, RotaJakiro can install persistence using a .desktop ﬁle under the
$HOME/.config/autostart/ folder.Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user’s desktop environment is
loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry ﬁles
(.desktop ) to conﬁgure the user’s desktop environment upon user login. These conﬁguration ﬁles determine what applications launch upon
user login, deﬁne associated applications to open speciﬁc ﬁle types, and deﬁne applications used to open removable media.
Adversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to the Exec directive in the
.desktop conﬁguration ﬁle. When the user’s desktop environment is loaded at user login, the .desktop ﬁles located in the XDG Autostart
directories are automatically executed. System-wide Autostart entries are located in the /etc/xdg/autostart directory while the user
entries are located in the ~/.config/autostart directory.
Adversaries may combine this technique with Masquerading to blend malicious Autostart entries with legitimate programs.Other sub-techniques of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (14)

ID Mitigation Description
M1033 Limit Software Installation Restrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned
software packages.
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsRestrict write access to XDG autostart entries to only select privileged users.
M1018 User Account Management Limit privileges of user accounts so only authorized privileged users can create and
modify XDG autostart entries.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may modify XDG autostart entries to
execute programs or commands during system boot.
DS0022 File File Creation Malicious XDG autostart entries may be detected by auditing ﬁle creation events within the
/etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart directories. Depending on individual
conﬁgurations, defenders may need to query the environment variables $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME or
$XDG\_CONFIG\_DIRS to determine the paths of Autostart entries. Autostart entry ﬁles not
associated with legitimate packages may be considered suspicious. Suspicious entries can
also be identiﬁed by comparing entries to a trusted system baseline.
File
ModiﬁcationMalicious XDG autostart entries may be detected by auditing ﬁle modiﬁcation events within
the /etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart directories. Depending on individual
conﬁgurations, defenders may need to query the environment variables $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME or
$XDG\_CONFIG\_DIRS to determine the paths of Autostart entries. Autostart entry ﬁles not
associated with legitimate packages may be considered suspicious. Suspicious entries can
also be identiﬁed by comparing entries to a trusted system baseline.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may modify XDG autostart entries to execute
programs or commands during system boot.
