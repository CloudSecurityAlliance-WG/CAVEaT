Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
ReferencesAdversaries may search freely available technical databases for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Information
about victims may be available in online databases and repositories, such as registrations of domains/certiﬁcates as well as public
collections of network data/artifacts gathered from traﬃc and/or scans.
Adversaries may search in different open databases depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources
may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing
operational resources (ex: Acquire Infrastructure or Compromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or
Trusted Relationship).Sub-techniques (5)
