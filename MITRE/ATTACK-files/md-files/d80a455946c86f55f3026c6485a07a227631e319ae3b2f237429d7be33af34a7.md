Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1051 Update Software A patch management process should be implemented to check unused dependencies, unmaintained
and/or previously vulnerable dependencies, unnecessary features, components, ﬁles, and documentation.
M1016 Vulnerability
ScanningContinuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools
should also be implemented as well.Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a ﬁnal consumer for the purpose of data or system
compromise.
Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:
Manipulation of development tools
Manipulation of a development environment
Manipulation of source code repositories (public or private)
Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies
Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms
Compromised/infected system images (multiple cases of removable media infected at the factory)
Replacement of legitimate software with modiﬁed versions
Sales of modiﬁed/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors
Shipment interdiction
While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, adversaries looking to gain execution have often
focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels. Targeting may be speciﬁc to a
desired victim set or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on speciﬁc
victims. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add
malicious code to users of the dependency.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Use veriﬁcation of distributed binaries through hash checking or other integrity checking
mechanisms. Scan downloads for malicious signatures and attempt to test software and
updates prior to deployment while taking note of potential suspicious activity.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Perform physical inspection of hardware to look for potential tampering. Perform integrity
checking on pre-OS boot mechanisms that can be manipulated for malicious purposes and
compare against known good baseline behavior.
