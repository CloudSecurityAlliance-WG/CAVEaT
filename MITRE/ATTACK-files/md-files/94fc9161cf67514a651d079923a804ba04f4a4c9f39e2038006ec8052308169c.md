Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1091 Pacu Pacu can enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit permissions to discover cloud infrastructure in accordance with least privilege. Organizations
should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative
privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement
reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.An adversary may attempt to discover infrastructure and resources that are available within an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
environment. This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other
services including the storage and database services.
Cloud providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve information about infrastructure. For example,
AWS provides a DescribeInstances API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an
account, the ListBuckets API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, the HeadBucket API to
determine a bucket’s existence along with access permissions of the request sender, or the GetPublicAccessBlock API to retrieve access
block conﬁguration for a bucket. Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the gcloud compute instances list command to list all
Google Compute Engine instances in a project , and Azure's CLI command az vm list lists details of virtual machines. In addition to
API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover cloud storage infrastructure through Wordlist Scanning.
An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user. The
discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing
Persistence.An adversary may also use this information to change the conﬁguration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data
to be accessed without authentication. Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as DescribeDBInstances to
determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources. Adversaries can use this information to determine the
potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them. Unlike in Cloud Service Discovery, this technique focuses on the
discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves.[1][2][3][4]

DS0010 Cloud StorageCloud Storage
EnumerationMonitor cloud logs for API calls and other potentially unusual activity related to cloud
data object storage enumeration. Discovery techniques normally occur throughout an
operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed
in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as
Collection and Exﬁltration, based on the information obtained.
DS0030 Instance Instance

instance enumeration. Discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as
an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation,
but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection
and Exﬁltration, based on the information obtained.
DS0020 Snapshot Snapshot
