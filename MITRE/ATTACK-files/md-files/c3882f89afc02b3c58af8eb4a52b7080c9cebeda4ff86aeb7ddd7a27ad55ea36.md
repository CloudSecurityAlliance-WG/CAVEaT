Obtain Capabilities: Vulnerabilities
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0034 Sandworm
TeamIn 2017, Sandworm Team conducted technical research related to vulnerabilities associated with websites
used by the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee, a Korean power company, and a Korean airport.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
Detection
Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection
efforts may be focused on behaviors relating to the potential use of exploits for vulnerabilities (i.e. Exploit Public-Facing Application,
Exploitation for Client Execution, Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, Exploitation for Defense Evasion, Exploitation for Credential Access,
Exploitation of Remote Services, and Application or System Exploitation).
ReferencesAdversaries may acquire information about vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. A vulnerability is a weakness in computer
hardware or software that can, potentially, be exploited by an adversary to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur. Adversaries
may ﬁnd vulnerability information by searching open databases or gaining access to closed vulnerability databases.
An adversary may monitor vulnerability disclosures/databases to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered,
vulnerabilities. There is usually a delay between when a vulnerability is discovered and when it is made public. An adversary may target the
systems of those known to conduct vulnerability research (including commercial vendors). Knowledge of a vulnerability may cause an
adversary to search for an existing exploit (i.e. Exploits) or to attempt to develop one themselves (i.e. Exploits).Other sub-techniques of Obtain Capabilities (6)
