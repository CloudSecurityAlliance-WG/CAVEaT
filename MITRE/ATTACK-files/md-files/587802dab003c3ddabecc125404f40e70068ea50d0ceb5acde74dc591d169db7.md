Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware
Supply Chain
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1046 Boot
IntegrityUse Trusted Platform Module technology and a secure or trusted boot process to prevent system integrity from
being compromised. Check the integrity of the existing BIOS or EFI to determine if it is vulnerable to
modiﬁcation. 
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Perform physical inspection of hardware to look for potential tampering. Perform integrity
checking on pre-OS boot mechanisms that can be manipulated for malicious purposes and
and compare against known good baseline behavior.
ReferencesAdversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a ﬁnal consumer for the purpose of data or system
compromise. By modifying hardware or ﬁrmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be
diﬃcult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices,
such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.Other sub-techniques of Supply Chain Compromise (3)
