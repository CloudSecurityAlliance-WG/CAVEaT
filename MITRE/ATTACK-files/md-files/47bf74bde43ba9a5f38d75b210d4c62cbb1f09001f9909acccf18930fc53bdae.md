https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001/ 3/6Stage Capabilities: Upload Malware
Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting. Malicious
software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content. Adversaries may
upload malware to support their operations, such as making a payload available to a victim network to enable Ingress Tool Transfer by
placing it on an Internet accessible web server.
Malware may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary (Acquire Infrastructure) or was otherwise
compromised by them (Compromise Infrastructure). Malware can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin, or hosted on
the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), where decentralized content storage makes the removal of malicious ﬁles diﬃcult.
Adversaries may upload backdoored ﬁles, such as application binaries, virtual machine images, or container images, to third-party software
stores or repositories (ex: GitHub, CNET, AWS Community AMIs, Docker Hub). By chance encounter, victims may directly download/install
these backdoored ﬁles via User Execution. Masquerading may increase the chance of users mistakenly executing these ﬁles.Other sub-techniques of Stage Capabilities (6)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in malware have been previously identiﬁed, internet scanning
may uncover when an adversary has staged malware to make it accessible for
targeting.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization,
making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be focused on post-
compromise phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as User Execution or Ingress Tool
