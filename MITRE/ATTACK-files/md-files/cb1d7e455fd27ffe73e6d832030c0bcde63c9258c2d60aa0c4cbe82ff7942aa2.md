Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0035 Dragonﬂy Dragonﬂy has modiﬁed the Registry to hide created user accounts.
G0094 Kimsuky Kimsuky has run reg add ‘HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList’ /v to hide a newly created user.
S0649 SMOKEDHAM SMOKEDHAM has modiﬁed the Registry to hide created user accounts from the Windows logon screen. Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify. Administrators may want to hide users when
there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their administrative or other management accounts from other users.
In macOS, adversaries can create or modify a user to be hidden through manipulating plist ﬁles, folder attributes, and user attributes. To
prevent a user from being shown on the login screen and in System Preferences, adversaries can set the userID to be under 500 and set the
key value Hide500Users to TRUE in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow plist ﬁle. Every user has a userID associated
with it. When the Hide500Users key value is set to TRUE , users with a userID under 500 do not appear on the login screen and in System
Preferences. Using the command line, adversaries can use the dscl utility to create hidden user accounts by setting the IsHidden attribute
to 1. Adversaries can also hide a user’s home folder by changing the chflags to hidden.
Adversaries may similarly hide user accounts in Windows. Adversaries can set the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList Registry key value to 0 for a speciﬁc user to prevent that user from being
listed on the logon screen.
On Linux systems, adversaries may hide user accounts from the login screen, also referred to as the greeter. The method an adversary may
use depends on which Display Manager the distribution is currently using. For example, on an Ubuntu system using the GNOME Display
Manger (GDM), accounts may be hidden from the greeter using the gsettings command (ex: sudo -u gdm gsettings set
org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list true ). Display Managers are not anchored to speciﬁc distributions and may be changed
by a user or adversary.Other sub-techniques of Hide Artifacts (11)

ID Mitigation Description
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationIf the computer is domain joined, then group policy can help restrict the ability to create or hide users.
Similarly, preventing the modiﬁcation of the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow
Hide500Users value will force all users to be visible.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that could be taken to add a new user
and subsequently hide it from login screens.
DS0022 File File Modiﬁcation Monitor for changes made to ﬁles that may use hidden users to mask the presence
of user accounts they create or modify. Monitor for changes made to the
/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow plist ﬁle for unexpected
modiﬁcations to the Hide500Users key value on macOS.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor newly executed processes for actions that could be taken to add a new
user and subsequently hide it from login screens.
DS0002 User Account User Account
CreationMonitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on
macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.
User Account
MetadataMonitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user
ID, environmental data that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or
modify. On macOS, identify users with an userID under 500 and the Hide500Users
key value in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow plist ﬁle set to
TRUE .
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to windows registry key or values for unexpected
modiﬁcations of the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList key.
