https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001/ 3/5Create or Modify System Process: Launch Agent
Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-
user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) ﬁle found in
/System/Library/LaunchAgents , /Library/LaunchAgents , and ~/Library/LaunchAgents . Property list ﬁles use the Label ,
ProgramArguments , and RunAtLoad keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time. Launch Agents
are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user speciﬁed programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.
Launch Agents can also be executed using the Launchctl command.
Adversaries may install a new Launch Agent that executes at login by placing a .plist ﬁle into the appropriate folders with the RunAtLoad or
KeepAlive keys set to true . The Launch Agent name may be disguised by using a name from the related operating system or benign
software. Launch Agents are created with user level privileges and execute with user level permissions.Other sub-techniques of Create or Modify System Process (4)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0482 Bundlore Bundlore can persist via a LaunchAgent.
S0274 Calisto Calisto adds a .plist ﬁle to the /Library/LaunchAgents folder to maintain persistence.
S0369 CoinTicker CoinTicker creates user launch agents named .espl.plist and com.apple.[random string].plist to
establish persistence.
S0492 CookieMiner CookieMiner has installed multiple new Launch Agents in order to maintain persistence for
cryptocurrency mining software.
S0235 CrossRAT CrossRAT creates a Launch Agent on macOS.
S0497 Dacls Dacls can establish persistence via a LaunchAgent.
S0281 Dok Dok installs two LaunchAgents to redirect all network traﬃc with a randomly generated name for
each plist ﬁle maintaining the format com.random.name.plist .
S0277 FruitFly FruitFly persists via a Launch Agent.
S0690 Green Lambert Green Lambert can create a Launch Agent with the RunAtLoad key-value pair set to true , ensuring
the com.apple.GrowlHelper.plist ﬁle runs every time a user logs in.
S0276 Keydnap Keydnap uses a Launch Agent to persist.
S0162 Komplex The Komplex trojan creates a persistent launch agent called with
$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.updates.plist with launchctl load -w
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.updates.plist .
S1016 MacMa MacMa installs a com.apple.softwareupdate.plist ﬁle in the /LaunchAgents folder with the
RunAtLoad value set to true . Upon user login, MacMa is executed from
/var/root/.local/softwareupdate with root privileges. Some variations also include the
LimitLoadToSessionType key with the value Aqua , ensuring the MacMa only runs when there is a
logged in GUI user.
S1048 macOS.OSAMiner macOS.OSAMiner has placed a Stripped Payloads with a plist extension in the Launch Agent's
folder. 
S0282 MacSpy MacSpy persists via a Launch Agent.
S0198 NETWIRE NETWIRE can use launch agents for persistence.
S0352 OSX\_OCEANLOTUS.D OSX\_OCEANLOTUS.D can create a persistence ﬁle in the folder /Library/LaunchAgents .
S0279 Proton Proton persists via Launch Agent.
S0595 ThiefQuest ThiefQuest installs a launch item using an embedded encrypted launch agent property list template.
The plist ﬁle is installed in the ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ folder and conﬁgured with the path to the
persistent binary located in the ~/Library/ folder.

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionEnsure Launch Agent's ProgramArguments key pointing to executables located in the /tmp
or /shared folders are in alignment with enterprise policy. Ensure all Launch Agents with the
RunAtLoad key set to true are in alignment with policy.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles that may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly
execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.
File
ModiﬁcationLaunch Agents also require ﬁles on disk for persistence which can also be monitored via
other ﬁle monitoring applications.
DS0019 Service Service Creation Monitor Launch Agent creation through additional plist ﬁles and utilities such as Objective-
See’s KnockKnock application.
Service
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as
part of persistence.
