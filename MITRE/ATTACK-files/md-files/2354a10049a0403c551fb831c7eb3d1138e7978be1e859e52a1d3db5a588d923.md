https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/ 3/12OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory
Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
(LSASS). After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. These credential
materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct Lateral Movement using Use Alternate Authentication
Material.
As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system.
For example, on the target host use procdump:
procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass\_dump
Locally, mimikatz can be run using:
sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp
sekurlsa::logonPasswords
Built-in Windows tools such as comsvcs.dll can also be used:
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID lsass.dmp full
Windows Security Support Provider (SSP) DLLs are loaded into LSASS process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have
access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card
PINs. The SSP conﬁguration is stored in two Registry keys: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages and
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages . An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new
SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.
The following SSPs can be used to access credentials:
Msv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons are done through the MSV authentication package.
Wdigest: The Digest Authentication protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication
Security Layer (SASL) exchanges.
Kerberos: Preferred for mutual client-server domain authentication in Windows 2000 and later.
CredSSP: Provides SSO and Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services.Other sub-techniques of OS Credential Dumping (8)

ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to secure LSASS and prevent credential
stealing. 
M1043 Credential Access
ProtectionWith Windows 10, Microsoft implemented new protections called Credential Guard to protect the LSA
secrets that can be used to obtain credentials through forms of credential dumping. It is not conﬁgured
by default and has hardware and ﬁrmware system requirements. It also does not protect against all
forms of credential dumping.
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationConsider disabling or restricting NTLM. Consider disabling WDigest authentication.
M1027 Password Policies Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the
network.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementDo not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless
they are tightly controlled, as this is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the
same password on all systems. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise
network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.
M1025 Privileged Process
IntegrityOn Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, enable Protected Process Light for LSA.
M1017 User Training Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use
the same password for multiple accounts.[92]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to access credential
material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem
Service (LSASS). Remote access tools may contain built-in features or incorporate
existing tools like Mimikatz. PowerShell scripts also exist that contain credential
dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module, which may
require additional logging features to be conﬁgured in the operating system to collect
necessary information for analysis.
Note: Event ID 4104 from the "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" log
captures Powershell script blocks, whose contents can be further analyzed to
determine if they’re performing LSASS dumping.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior from credentials being accessed by
process memory of the LSASS. For example, detect behaviors of Secretsdump
against a system, not being a Domain Controller.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may attempt to access credential material stored in the
process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). OS API
calls associated with LSASS process dumping include OpenProcess and
MiniDumpWriteDump . Execution of these functions might trigger security log ids such
as 4663 (Microsoft Security Auditing) and 10 (Microsoft Sysmon)
Note: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer
volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based
on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes)
can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary.[98]3/22/24, 3:47 PM OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory, Sub-technique T1003.001 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/ 9/12ID Data Source Data Component Detects
Process Access Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS.exe. Common credential
dumpers such as Mimikatz access LSASS.exe by opening the process, locating the
LSA secrets key, and decrypting the sections in memory where credential details are
stored. Credential dumpers may also use methods for reﬂective Process Injection to
reduce potential indicators of malicious activity.
Usage of Procdump and Windows Task Manager for LSASS dumping can also be
detected via process creation events, since they both have a predictable set of
command-line arguments (i.e., for specifying the process to be dumped).
Note: Sysmon process access events (Event ID 10) can be extremely noisy, which
necessitates tweaking the Sysmon conﬁguration ﬁle. We recommend taking an
approach analogous to that of the Sysmon Modular Conﬁguration project
(https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular) and ﬁltering out any benign
processes in your environment that produce large volumes of process access events.
The GrantedAccess value in the below analytic for Mimikatz is meant to be used
solely as an illustrative example of detecting Mimikatz LSASS access. However,
actual GrantedAccess values change over time with different versions of Mimikatz
and therefore detection engineers need to verify the accuracy of any GrantedAccess
values that their analytics are using.
Analytic 1 - Mimikatz
processes = filter processes where (event\_id == "10" AND target\_process
== "\*lsass.exe" AND granted\_access == "0x1410")
Analytic 2 - Procdump
processes = filter processes where (event\_id == "10" AND target\_process
== "lsass.exe" AND source\_process == " procdump.exe")
Analytic 3 - Windows Task Manager
processes = filter processes where (event\_id == "10" AND target\_process
== "\*lsass.exe" AND source\_process == "c:\windows\*\taskmgr.exe")
Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may be indicative of credential dumping.
On Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, monitor Windows Logs for LSASS.exe
creation to verify that LSASS started as a protected process. Try monitoring for
Sysmon Event ID 1 and/or Windows Security Event ID 4688 for process activity.
Note: Rundll32/MiniDump has a different command-line syntax than that of
Procdump, in that the process being dumped is speciﬁed via process ID instead of
name (as with Procdump). Therefore, because the LSASS process ID is non-
deterministic, the MiniDump detection isn’t speciﬁc to LSASS dumping and may need
to be tuned to help reduce false positives.
Analytic 1 - Procdump
processes = filter processes where ((event\_id == "1" OR event\_id ==
"4688") AND exe == "procdump .exe" and command\_line == " lsass\*")
Analytic 2 - MiniDump via rundll32
processes = filter processes where ((event\_id == "1" OR event\_id ==
"4688") AND exe == " rundll32.exe" and command\_line == " comsvcs.dll
MiniDump\*")
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes to Registry entries associated with credential access that is
stored in the process memory of the LSASS. For example, the adversary can modify
the SAM and SYSTEM ﬁles.[99]3/22/24, 3:47 PM OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory, Sub-technique T1003.001 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
