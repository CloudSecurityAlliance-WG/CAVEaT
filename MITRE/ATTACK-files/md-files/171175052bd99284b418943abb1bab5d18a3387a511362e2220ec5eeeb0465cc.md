https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/003/ 3/7Hide Artifacts: Hidden Window
Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would
typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid
disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks.
On Windows, there are a variety of features in scripting languages in Windows, such as PowerShell, Jscript, and Visual Basic to make
windows hidden. One example of this is powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden . 
Similarly, on macOS the conﬁgurations for how applications run are listed in property list (plist) ﬁles. One of the tags in these ﬁles can be
apple.awt.UIElement , which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for
this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.
Adversaries may abuse these functionalities to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on
the system.Other sub-techniques of Hide Artifacts (11)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may use hidden windows to conceal
malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In Windows, enable and conﬁgure event
logging and PowerShell logging to check for the hidden window style.
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to ﬁles that may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity
from the plain sight of users. In MacOS, plist ﬁles are ASCII text ﬁles with a speciﬁc format, so
they're relatively easy to parse. File monitoring can check for the apple.awt.UIElement or
any other suspicious plist tag in plist ﬁles and ﬂag them.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may use hidden windows to conceal malicious
activity from the plain sight of users.
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of
cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be
captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and intent.3/22/24, 3:42 PM Hide Artifacts: Hidden Window, Sub-technique T1564.003 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
