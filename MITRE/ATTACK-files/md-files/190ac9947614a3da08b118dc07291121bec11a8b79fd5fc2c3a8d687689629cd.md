Authentication
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0114 Chimera Chimera's malware has altered the NTLM authentication program on domain controllers to allow Chimera to
login without a valid credential.
S0007 Skeleton
KeySkeleton Key is used to patch an enterprise domain controller authentication process with a backdoor password.
It allows adversaries to bypass the standard authentication system to use a deﬁned password for all accounts
authenticating to that domain controller.Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable
access to accounts.
Malware may be used to inject false credentials into the authentication process on a domain controller with the intent of creating a backdoor
used to access any user’s account and/or credentials (ex: Skeleton Key). Skeleton key works through a patch on an enterprise domain
controller authentication process (LSASS) with credentials that adversaries may use to bypass the standard authentication system. Once
patched, an adversary can use the injected password to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton key is
erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller). Authenticated access may enable unfettered access to hosts and/or resources
within single-factor authentication environments.Other sub-techniques of Modify Authentication Process (8)

ID Mitigation Description
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationIntegrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk
of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as
initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to
cloud resources and APIs.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementAudit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that
could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. 
These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are
created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise
network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers. 
M1025 Privileged
Process IntegrityEnabled features, such as Protected Process Light (PPL), for LSA.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes to functions exported from authentication-related system DLLs (such
as cryptdll.dll and samsrv.dll).
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across systems that share accounts, either
user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems
simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously;
accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business
hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from
accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.
Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login
session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). Conﬁgure robust,
consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally
accessible services.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls to OpenProcess that can be used to manipulate lsass.exe running on
a domain controller
Process
AccessMonitor for unexpected processes interacting with the authentication process on a
domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to
accounts.
