https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010/ 3/8System Binary Proxy Execution: Regsvr32
Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and
unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. The Regsvr32.exe binary
may also be signed by Microsoft. 
Malicious usage of Regsvr32.exe may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the
regsvr32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe can
also be used to speciﬁcally bypass application control using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions.
Since Regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to ﬁle on an external
Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered,
only executed. This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" and has been used in campaigns targeting
governments. 
Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish persistence via Component Object Model Hijacking. Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1050 Exploit
ProtectionMicrosoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) feature can be
used to block regsvr32.exe from being used to bypass application control. Identify and block potentially
malicious software executed through regsvr32 functionality by using application control tools, like
Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where
appropriate. [38][39]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionCommand arguments used before and after the regsvr32.exe invocation may also be
useful in determining the origin and purpose of the script or DLL being loaded. 
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as the
loading of DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally
loaded into a process.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted
hosts.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of regsvr32.exe.
Compare recent invocations of regsvr32.exe with prior history of known good arguments
and loaded ﬁles to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.
Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log
(Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). - Analytic 1 is a more generic analytic
that looks for suspicious usage of regsvr32.exe, speciﬁcally for cases where regsvr32.exe
creates child processes that aren’t itself. It’s not likely that this will result in millions of
hits, but it does occur during benign activity so some form of baselining would be
necessary for this to be useful as an alerting analytic.- Analytic 2 is around "Squiblydoo",
which is a speciﬁc usage of regsvr32.exe to load a COM scriptlet directly from the
internet and execute it in a way that bypasses application whitelisting. It looks for
regsvr32.exe process creation events that load scrobj.dll via the command-line (which
executes the COM scriptlet).
