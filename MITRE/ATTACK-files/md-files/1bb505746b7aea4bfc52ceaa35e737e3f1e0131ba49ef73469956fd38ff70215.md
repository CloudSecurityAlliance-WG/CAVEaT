https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/ 3/5Endpoint Denial of Service
Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS
can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash
condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting
DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.
An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can
target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating
Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of
them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A
DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a
distributed DoS (DDoS).
To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spooﬁng and botnets.
Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traﬃc more diﬃcult
to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reﬂection. This can increase the diﬃculty defenders have in defending against the attack
by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of ﬁltering by the source address on network defense devices.
Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a signiﬁcant amount of
traﬃc from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet
infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used
to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traﬃc to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's
resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traﬃc from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly diﬃcult. Botnets have been used
in some of the most high-proﬁle DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.
In cases where traﬃc manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traﬃc gateway routers) where packets
can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of
capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traﬃc was modiﬁed to include a reference to
JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.

ID Name Description
S0052 OnionDuke OnionDuke has the capability to use a Denial of Service module.
G0034 Sandworm
TeamSandworm Team temporarily disrupted service to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector
websites after compromising a Georgian web hosting provider in 2019.
S0412 ZxShell ZxShell has a feature to perform SYN ﬂood attack on a host.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1037 Filter
Network
TraﬃcLeverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations to
ﬁlter traﬃc upstream from services. Filter boundary traﬃc by blocking source addresses sourcing the
attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport. To defend against
SYN ﬂoods, enable SYN Cookies.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of
services to users. In addition to network level detections, endpoint logging and
instrumentation can be useful for detection. Attacks targeting web applications may
generate logs in the web server, application server, and/or database server that can be
used to identify the type of attack, possibly before the impact is felt. Externally monitor
the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Detection of Endpoint DoS can sometimes be achieved before the effect is suﬃcient to
cause signiﬁcant impact to the availability of the service, but such response time
typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness. Monitor for logging,
messaging, and other artifacts highlighting the health of host sensors (ex: metrics,
errors, and/or exceptions from logging applications)[6]
