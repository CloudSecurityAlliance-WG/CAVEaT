https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/001/ 3/4Oﬃce Application Startup: Oﬃce Template Macros
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0475 BackConﬁg BackConﬁg has the ability to use hidden columns in Excel spreadsheets to store executable ﬁles or
commands for VBA macros.
S0154 Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike has the ability to use an Excel Workbook to execute additional code by enabling Oﬃce to trust
macros and execute code without user permission.
G0069 MuddyWater MuddyWater has used a Word Template, Normal.dotm, for persistence.Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Oﬃce templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Microsoft Oﬃce contains templates
that are part of common Oﬃce applications and are used to customize styles. The base templates within the application are used each time
an application starts. 
Oﬃce Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros can be inserted into the base template and used to execute code when the respective
Oﬃce application starts in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published. By default,
Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modiﬁed to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a template ﬁle created by
default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded. Shared templates may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.
Word Normal.dotm location:
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm
Excel Personal.xlsb location:
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB
Adversaries may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by hijacking the application's search order, e.g. Word
2016 will ﬁrst look for Normal.dotm under C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\ , or by modifying the
GlobalDotName registry key. By modifying the GlobalDotName registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, ﬁle name, and ﬁle
extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application startup. To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may ﬁrst need to register
the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location.
An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.Other sub-techniques of Oﬃce Application Startup (6)

ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Oﬃce applications from
creating child processes and from writing potentially malicious executable content to disk. 
M1042 Disable or
Remove Feature
or ProgramFollow Oﬃce macro security best practices suitable for your environment. Disable Oﬃce VBA macros
from executing.
Disable Oﬃce add-ins. If they are required, follow best practices for securing them by requiring them to
be signed and disabling user notiﬁcation for allowing add-ins. For some add-ins types (WLL, VBA)
additional mitigation is likely required as disabling add-ins in the Oﬃce Trust Center does not disable
WLL nor does it prevent VBA code from executing. 
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse Microsoft Oﬃce
templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles that may abuse Microsoft Oﬃce templates to
obtain persistence on a compromised system.
File Modiﬁcation Monitor for changes made to ﬁles that may abuse Microsoft Oﬃce templates to
obtain persistence on a compromised system. Modiﬁcation to base templates, like
Normal.dotm, should also be investigated since the base templates should likely
not contain VBA macros. Changes to the Oﬃce macro security settings should also
be investigated
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor newly executed processes that may abuse Microsoft Oﬃce templates to
obtain persistence on a compromised system.
