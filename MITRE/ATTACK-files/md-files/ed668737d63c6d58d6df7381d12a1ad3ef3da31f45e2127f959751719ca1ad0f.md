Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0168 Gazer Gazer can establish persistence through the system screensaver by conﬁguring it to execute the malware.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or Program Use Group Policy to disable screensavers if they are unnecessary.
M1038 Execution Prevention Block .scr ﬁles from being executed from non-standard locations.Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute
after a conﬁgurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) ﬁles with a .scr ﬁle extension. The Windows screensaver
application scrnsave.scr is located in C:\Windows\System32\ , and C:\Windows\sysWOW64\ on 64-bit Windows systems, along with
screensavers included with base Windows installations.
The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\ ) and could be manipulated to achieve
persistence:
SCRNSAVE.exe - set to malicious PE path
ScreenSaveActive - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
ScreenSaverIsSecure - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
ScreenSaveTimeout - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed
Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user
inactivity.Other sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)

File Modiﬁcation Monitor for changes made to ﬁles that may establish persistence by executing
malicious content triggered by user inactivity.
Note: Although there are no standard events for ﬁle modiﬁcation, Windows Event ID
4663 (An Attempt Was Made to Access An Object) can be used to alert on attempted
accesses of screensaver ﬁles (typically ending in a ﬁle extension of .scr).3/22/24, 3:39 PM Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver, Sub-technique T1546.002 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®

Key ModiﬁcationMonitor changes to screensaver conﬁguration changes in the Registry that may not
correlate with typical user behavior. Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns can be
used to detect changes to the screensaver binary path in the Registry. Default screen
saver ﬁles are stored in C:\Windows\System32. Use these ﬁles as a reference when
deﬁning list of not suspicious screen saver ﬁles.
