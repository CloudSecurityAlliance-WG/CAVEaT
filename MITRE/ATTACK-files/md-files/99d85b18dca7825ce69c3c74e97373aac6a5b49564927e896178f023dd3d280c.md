Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0030 Carbanak Carbanak downloads an executable and injects it directly into a new process.
G0078 Gorgon
GroupGorgon Group malware can download a remote access tool, ShiftyBug, and inject into another process.
S0342 GreyEnergy GreyEnergy has a module to inject a PE binary into a remote process.
S0260 InvisiMole InvisiMole can inject its backdoor as a portable executable into a target process.
S0681 Lizar Lizar can execute PE ﬁles in the address space of the speciﬁed process.
G0106 Rocke Rocke's miner, "TermsHost.exe", evaded defenses by injecting itself into Windows processes, including
Notepad.exe.
S0330 Zeus Panda Zeus Panda checks processes on the system and if they meet the necessary requirements, it injects into that
process.Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate
privileges. PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
PE injection is commonly performed by copying code (perhaps without a ﬁle on disk) into the virtual address space of the target process
before invoking it via a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and
WriteProcessMemory , then invoked with CreateRemoteThread or additional code (ex: shellcode). The displacement of the injected code
does introduce the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. 
Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
elevated privileges. Execution via PE injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a
legitimate process.Other sub-techniques of Process Injection (12)

ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be conﬁgured to block some types of process injection based
on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a
signiﬁcant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under
speciﬁc circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions
may be common and diﬃcult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such
as CreateRemoteThread and those that can be used to modify memory within another
process, such as VirtualAllocEx /WriteProcessMemory , may be used for this technique.
Process
AccessMonitor for processes being viewed that may inject portable executables (PE) into processes
in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Process
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to processes that may inject portable executables (PE) into
processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
