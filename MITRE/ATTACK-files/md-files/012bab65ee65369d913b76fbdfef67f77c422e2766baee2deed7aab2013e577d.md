https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/005/ 3/4Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0117 Fox Kitten Fox Kitten has used scripts to access credential information from the KeePass database.
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has accessed local password managers and databases to obtain further credentials from a
compromised network.
S0652 MarkiRAT MarkiRAT can gather information from the Keepass password manager.
C0014 Operation
WocaoDuring Operation Wocao, threat actors accessed and collected credentials from password managers.
S0279 Proton Proton gathers credentials in ﬁles for 1password.
G0027 Threat Group-
3390Threat Group-3390 obtained a KeePass database from a compromised host.
S0266 TrickBot TrickBot can steal passwords from the KeePass open source password manager.Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. Password managers are applications designed to store
user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that
unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as ﬁles
on disk.
Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from
memory. Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via Exploitation for Credential Access. Adversaries may also try brute
forcing via Password Guessing to obtain the master password of a password manager.Other sub-techniques of Credentials from Password Stores (6)

ID Mitigation Description
M1027 Password Policies Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies for master passwords.
M1054 Software
ConﬁgurationConsider re-locking password managers after a short timeout to limit the time plaintext credentials live
in memory from decrypted databases.
M1051 Update Software Update password managers regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise
endpoints and servers.
