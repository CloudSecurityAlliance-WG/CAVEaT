Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business relationships that can be used during targeting. Information about an
organization’s business relationships may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed
service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access. This information may also reveal supply
chains and shipment paths for the victim’s hardware and software resources.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Information about business
relationships may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned
Websites). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search
Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:
Supply Chain Compromise, Drive-by Compromise, or Trusted Relationship).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Org Information (4)
