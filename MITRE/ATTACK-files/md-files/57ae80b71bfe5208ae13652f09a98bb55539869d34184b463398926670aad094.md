https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/ 3/5Template Injection
Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts. For
example, Microsoft’s Oﬃce Open XML (OOX ML) speciﬁcation deﬁnes an XML-based format for Oﬃce documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to
replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). OOX ML ﬁles are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML ﬁles, referred to as
parts, containing properties that collectively deﬁne how a document is rendered.
Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs. For example, template properties may reference a
ﬁle, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.
Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents. Template references injected
into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded. These documents can be
delivered via other techniques such as Phishing and/or Taint Shared Content and may evade static detections since no typical indicators
(VBA macro, script, etc.) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched. Examples have been seen in the wild where template
injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.
Adversaries may also modify the \*\template control word within an .rtf ﬁle to similarly conceal then download malicious code. This
legitimate control word value is intended to be a ﬁle destination of a template ﬁle resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf ﬁle is
opened. However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf ﬁle to insert a template control word ﬁeld to include a URL resource of a
malicious payload.
This technique may also enable Forced Authentication by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an
authentication attempt.[1]

ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 used weaponized Microsoft Word documents abusing the remote template function to retrieve a
malicious macro. 
S0631 Chaes Chaes changed the template target of the settings.xml ﬁle embedded in the Word document and populated
that ﬁeld with the downloaded URL of the next payload.
G0142 Confucius Confucius has used a weaponized Microsoft Word document with an embedded RTF exploit.
G0079 DarkHydrus DarkHydrus used an open-source tool, Phishery, to inject malicious remote template URLs into Microsoft
Word documents and then sent them to victims to enable Forced Authentication.
G0035 Dragonﬂy Dragonﬂy has injected SMB URLs into malicious Word spearphishing attachments to initiate Forced
Authentication.
C0001 Frankenstein During Frankenstein, the threat actors used trojanized documents that retrieved remote templates from an
adversary-controlled website.
G0047 Gamaredon
GroupGamaredon Group has used DOCX ﬁles to download malicious DOT document templates and has used
RTF template injection to download malicious payloads. Gamaredon Group can also inject malicious
macros or remote templates into documents already present on compromised systems.
G0100 Inception Inception has used decoy documents to load malicious remote payloads via HTTP.
C0022 Operation
Dream JobDuring Operation Dream Job, Lazarus Group used DOCX ﬁles to retrieve a malicious document
template/DOTM ﬁle.
G0081 Tropic Trooper Tropic Trooper delivered malicious documents with the XLSX extension, typically used by OpenXML
documents, but the ﬁle itself was actually an OLE (XLS) document.
S0670 WarzoneRAT WarzoneRAT has been install via template injection through a malicious DLL embedded within a template
RTF in a Word document.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Network/Host intrusion prevention systems, antivirus, and detonation chambers can be
employed to prevent documents from fetching and/or executing malicious payloads.
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature
or ProgramConsider disabling Microsoft Oﬃce macros/active content to prevent the execution of
malicious payloads in documents , though this setting may not mitigate the Forced
Authentication use for this technique.
M1031 Network Intrusion Prevention Network/Host intrusion prevention systems, antivirus, and detonation chambers can be
employed to prevent documents from fetching and/or executing malicious payloads.
M1017 User Training Train users to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails that could be
used to deliver malicious documents.[10]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s)
that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous
packets that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc
patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring
and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line
arguments associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do
not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
DS0009 Process Process
CreationAnalyze process behavior to determine if an Oﬃce application is performing actions,
such as opening network connections, reading ﬁles, spawning abnormal child processes
(ex: PowerShell), or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise
behavior.
