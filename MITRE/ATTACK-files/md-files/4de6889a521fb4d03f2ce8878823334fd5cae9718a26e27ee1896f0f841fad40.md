Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0087 APT39 APT39 has used malware to set LoadAppInit\_DLLs in the Registry key SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Windows in order to establish persistence.
S0107 Cherry
PickerSome variants of Cherry Picker use AppInit\_DLLs to achieve persistence by creating the following Registry key:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
"AppInit\_DLLs"="pserver32.dll"
S0458 Ramsay Ramsay can insert itself into the address space of other applications using the AppInit DLL Registry key.
S0098 T9000 If a victim meets certain criteria, T9000 uses the AppInit\_DLL functionality to achieve persistence by ensuring that
every user mode process that is spawned will load its malicious DLL, ResN32.dll. It does this by creating the
following Registry keys: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit\_DLLs –
%APPDATA%\Intel\ResN32.dll and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\LoadAppInit\_DLLs – 0x1 .Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into
processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are speciﬁed in the AppInit\_DLLs value in the Registry keys
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows or
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows are loaded by user32.dll into every
process that loads user32.dll. In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library. 
Similar to Process Injection, these values can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the
context of separate processes on the computer. Malicious AppInit DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by
API activity.
The AppInit DLL functionality is disabled in Windows 8 and later versions when secure boot is enabled. Other sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)

ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution
PreventionAdversaries can install new AppInit DLLs binaries to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially
malicious software executed through AppInit DLLs functionality by using application control tools, like
Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where
appropriate. 
M1051 Update
SoftwareUpgrade to Windows 8 or later and enable secure boot.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence and/or
elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into
processes.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL loads by processes that load user32.dll and look for DLLs that are not
recognized or not normally loaded into a process.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor and analyze application programming interface (API) calls that are indicative
of Registry edits such as RegCreateKeyEx and RegSetValueEx . 
Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence and/or elevate
privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into
processes.
Note: Sysmon Event ID 1 (process create) and Windows Security Log Event ID 4688 (a
new process has been created) can be used to detect new reg.exe processes that
modify the AppInit DLL registry keys since the registry keys are speciﬁed as a
command-line parameter.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
ModiﬁcationMonitor the AppInit\_DLLs Registry values for modiﬁcations that do not correlate with
known software, patch cycles, etc. Adversaries may establish persistence and/or
elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into
processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are speciﬁed in the AppInit\_DLLs value in
the Registry keys HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Windows or
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Windows are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads
user32.dll. These values can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a
malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes. Accordingly,
this analytic looks for modiﬁcations to these registry keys that may be indicative of this
type of abuse.
