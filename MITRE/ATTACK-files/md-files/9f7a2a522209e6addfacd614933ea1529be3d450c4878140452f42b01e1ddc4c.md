Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature
or ProgramEnsure that agent forwarding is disabled on systems that do not explicitly require this feature
to prevent misuse. 
M1027 Password Policies Ensure SSH key pairs have strong passwords and refrain from using key-store technologies
such as ssh-agent unless they are properly protected.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementDo not allow remote access via SSH as root or other privileged accounts.
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsEnsure proper ﬁle permissions are set and harden system to prevent root privilege escalation
opportunities.Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment. Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of
remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly
authenticating through a password, certiﬁcate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.
In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems
via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through
compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking
SSH sessions is likely trivial.
SSH Hijacking differs from use of SSH because it hijacks an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using Valid Accounts.Other sub-techniques of Remote Service Session Hijacking (2)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may hijack a legitimate user's SSH
session to move laterally within an environment.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access
patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time. Also monitor user SSH-
agent socket ﬁles being used by different users.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to
move laterally within an environment.
