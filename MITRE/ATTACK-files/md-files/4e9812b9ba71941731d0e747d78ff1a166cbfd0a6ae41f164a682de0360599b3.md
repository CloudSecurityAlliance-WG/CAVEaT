https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/001/ 3/6Develop Capabilities: Malware
Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting. Building malicious software can include the
development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, C2 protocols, and the
creation of infected removable media. Adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining
control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.
As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing malware. The skills needed may be located in-
house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's malware development
capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the malware.
Some aspects of malware development, such as C2 protocol development, may require adversaries to obtain additional infrastructure. For
example, malware developed that will communicate with Twitter for C2, may require use of Web Services.Other sub-techniques of Develop Capabilities (4)

ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0004 Malware RepositoryMalware
ContentConsider analyzing malware for features that may be associated with the adversary
and/or their developers, such as compiler used, debugging artifacts, or code
similarities. Malware repositories can also be used to identify additional samples
associated with the adversary and identify development patterns over time.
Malware
MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a malicious payload, such as compilation times,
ﬁle hashes, as well as watermarks or other identiﬁable conﬁguration information.
Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization,
making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be focused on post-
compromise phases of the adversary lifecycle.3/22/24, 3:34 PM Develop Capabilities: Malware, Sub-technique T1587.001 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
