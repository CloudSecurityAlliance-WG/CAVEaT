https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/ 3/5Traﬃc Signaling
Adversaries may use traﬃc signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.
Traﬃc signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening
a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port
will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a
predeﬁned sequence of closed ports (i.e. Port Knocking), but can involve unusual ﬂags, speciﬁc strings, or other unique characteristics. After
the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based ﬁrewall, but could also be implemented by custom
software.
Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger
other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).
The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally
implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which
enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.
On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the
device such as telnet. Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modiﬁcation of
malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities. Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to
connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on
the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives. To enable this traﬃc signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must
ﬁrst achieve and leverage Patch System Image due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.
Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a
powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a
target for lateral movement.Sub-techniques (2)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0220 Chaos Chaos provides a reverse shell is triggered upon receipt of a packet with a special string, sent to any port.
S0641 Kobalos Kobalos is triggered by an incoming TCP connection to a legitimate service from a speciﬁc source port.
S0664 Pandora Pandora can identify if incoming HTTP traﬃc contains a token and if so it will intercept the traﬃc and process
the received command.
S0587 Penquin Penquin will connect to C2 only after sniﬃng a "magic packet" value in TCP or UDP packets matching speciﬁc
conditions.
S0446 Ryuk Ryuk has used Wake-on-Lan to power on turned off systems for lateral movement.
S0519 SYNful
KnockSYNful Knock can be sent instructions via special packets to change its functionality. Code for new
functionality can be included in these messages.
S0221 Umbreon Umbreon provides additional access using its backdoor Espeon, providing a reverse shell upon receipt of a
special packet.
S0022 Uroburos Uroburos can intercept the ﬁrst client to server packet in the 3-way TCP handshake to determine if the packet
contains the correct unique value for a speciﬁc Uroburos implant. If the value does not match, the packet and
the rest of the TCP session are passed to the legitimate listening application.
S0430 Winnti for
LinuxWinnti for Linux has used a passive listener, capable of identifying a speciﬁc magic value before executing
tasking, as a secondary command and control (C2) mechanism.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature
or ProgramDisable Wake-on-LAN if it is not needed within an environment.
M1037 Filter Network Traﬃc Mitigation of some variants of this technique could be achieved through the use of stateful
ﬁrewalls, depending upon how it is implemented.[7]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze network packet contents to detect application layer protocols,
leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traﬃc, that do not follow the expected
protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to
established ﬂows, protocol port mismatch, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider
packet inspection for Wake-on-LAN magic packet consists of 6 bytes of FF followed by
sixteen repetitions of the target system's IEEE address. Seeing this string anywhere in a
packet's payload may be indicative of a Wake-on-LAN attempt.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor and analyze network ﬂows associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the
expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong
to established ﬂows, or gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns). Consider analyzing
newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts,
unexpcted hardware devices, or other uncommon data ﬂows.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationIdentify running processes with raw sockets. Ensure processes listed have a need for an
open raw socket and are in accordance with enterprise policy.
