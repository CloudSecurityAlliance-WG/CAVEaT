Permissions
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 has used a Powershell cmdlet to grant the ApplicationImpersonation role to a compromised
account.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has used a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal
with ApplicationImpersonation rights to start collecting emails from targeted mailboxes; APT29 has
also used compromised accounts holding ApplicationImpersonation rights in Exchange to collect
emails.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound granted compromised email accounts read access to the email boxes of additional targeted
accounts. The group then was able to authenticate to the intended victim's OWA (Outlook Web Access)
portal and read hundreds of email communications for information on Middle East organizations.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using
Set-CASMailbox , allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes. It also added additional permissions
(such as Mail.Read and Mail.ReadWrite) to compromised Application or Service Principals.Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.
For example, the Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Oﬃce 365,
adds permissions to a mailbox. In Google Workspace, delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console and users can delegate
accounts via their Gmail settings.
Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles. In Oﬃce 365 environments,
adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or other mailbox
folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain
persistence to the target user’s mail folders.
This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add
Additional Cloud Roles to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to
systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target
business while creating inbox rules (ex: Internal Spearphishing), so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.Other sub-techniques of Account Manipulation (6)

ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature
or ProgramIf email delegation is not required, disable it. In Google Workspace this can be accomplished
through the Google Admin console.
M1032 Multi-factor Authentication Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementDo not allow domain administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may
expose them to potential adversaries on unprivileged systems.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentEnable the UpdateFolderPermissions action for all logon types. The mailbox audit log
will forward folder permission modiﬁcation events to the Uniﬁed Audit Log. Create rules
to alert on ModifyFolderPermissions operations where the Anonymous or Default user
is assigned permissions other than None.
A larger than normal volume of emails sent from an account and similar phishing
emails sent from real accounts within a network may be a sign that an account was
compromised and attempts to leverage access with modiﬁed email permissions is
occurring.
DS0036 Group Group
ModiﬁcationMonitor for unusual Exchange and Oﬃce 365 email account permissions changes that
may indicate excessively broad permissions (including memberships in privileged
groups) being granted to compromised accounts.
DS0002 User Account User Account
ModiﬁcationMonitor for unusual Exchange and Oﬃce 365 email account permissions changes that
may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.
