https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/ 3/8Exploit Public-Facing Application
Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the
system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconﬁguration.
Exploited applications are often websites/web servers, but can also include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH),
network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other system with Internet accessible
open sockets. Depending on the ﬂaw being exploited this may also involve Exploitation for Defense Evasion.
If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying
instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via Escape to
Host, or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.
Adversaries may also exploit edge network infrastructure and related appliances, speciﬁcally targeting devices that do not support robust
host-based defenses.
For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.[1][2][3][4][5]

ID Mitigation Description
M1048 Application Isolation
and SandboxingApplication isolation will limit what other processes and system features the exploited target can
access.
M1050 Exploit Protection Web Application Firewalls may be used to limit exposure of applications to prevent exploit traﬃc
from reaching the application.
M1030 Network Segmentation Segment externally facing servers and services from the rest of the network with a DMZ or on
separate hosting infrastructure.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementUse least privilege for service accounts will limit what permissions the exploited process gets on
