https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485/ 3/6Data Destruction
Adversaries may destroy data and ﬁles on speciﬁc systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services,
and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting ﬁles or data
on local and remote drives. Common operating system ﬁle deletion commands such as del and rm often only remove pointers
to ﬁles without wiping the contents of the ﬁles themselves, making the ﬁles recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is
distinct from Disk Content Wipe and Disk Structure Wipe because individual ﬁles are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the
disk's logical structure.
Adversaries may attempt to overwrite ﬁles and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable. In some cases
politically oriented image ﬁles have been used to overwrite data.
To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for
destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like Valid Accounts, OS
Credential Dumping, and SMB/Windows Admin Shares. .
In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage, cloud storage accounts, machine images, and other
infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0082 APT38 APT38 has used a custom secure delete function to make deleted ﬁles unrecoverable.
S0089 BlackEnergy BlackEnergy 2 contains a "Destroy" plug-in that destroys data stored on victim hard drives by overwriting
ﬁle contents.
S0693 CaddyWiper CaddyWiper can work alphabetically through drives on a compromised system to take ownership of and
overwrite all ﬁles.
S0659 Diavol Diavol can delete speciﬁed ﬁles from a targeted system.
G0047 Gamaredon
GroupGamaredon Group has used tools to delete ﬁles and folders from victims' desktops and proﬁles.
S0697 HermeticWiper HermeticWiper can recursively wipe folders and ﬁles in Windows , Program Files , Program Files(x86) ,
PerfLogs , Boot, System , Volume Information , and AppData folders using FSCTL\_MOVE\_FILE .
HermeticWiper can also overwrite symbolic links and big ﬁles in My Documents and on the Desktop with
random bytes.
S0604 Industroyer Industroyer’s data wiper module clears registry keys and overwrites both ICS conﬁguration and Windows
ﬁles.
S0265 Kazuar Kazuar can overwrite ﬁles with random data before deleting them.
S0607 KillDisk KillDisk deletes system ﬁles to make the OS unbootable. KillDisk also targets and deletes ﬁles with 35
different ﬁle extensions.
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has deleted the target's systems and resources both on-premises and in the cloud.
G0032 Lazarus Group Lazarus Group has used a custom secure delete function to overwrite ﬁle contents with data from heap
memory.
S0688 Meteor Meteor can ﬁll a victim's ﬁles and directories with zero-bytes in replacement of real content before deleting
them.
S0365 Olympic
DestroyerOlympic Destroyer overwrites ﬁles locally and on remote shares.
S0139 PowerDuke PowerDuke has a command to write random data across a ﬁle and delete it.
S0238 Proxysvc Proxysvc can overwrite ﬁles indicated by the attacker before deleting them.
S0364 RawDisk RawDisk was used in Shamoon to write to protected system locations such as the MBR and disk partitions
in an effort to destroy data.
S0496 REvil REvil has the capability to destroy ﬁles and folders.
G0034 Sandworm
TeamSandworm Team has used the BlackEnergy KillDisk component to overwrite ﬁles on Windows-based
Human-Machine Interfaces. 
S0195 SDelete SDelete deletes data in a way that makes it unrecoverable.
S0140 Shamoon Shamoon attempts to overwrite operating system ﬁles and disk structures with image ﬁles. In a later
variant, randomly generated data was used for data overwrites.
S0380 StoneDrill StoneDrill has a disk wiper module that targets ﬁles other than those in the Windows directory.[9]

S0689 WhisperGate WhisperGate can corrupt ﬁles by overwriting the ﬁrst 1 MB with 0xcc and appending random extensions.
S0341 Xbash Xbash has destroyed Linux-based databases as part of its ransomware capabilities.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1053 Data
BackupConsider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that
can be used to restore organizational data. Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from
common methods adversaries may use to gain access and destroy the backups to prevent recovery.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0010 Cloud StorageCloud Storage
DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of a cloud storage infrastructure, such as the
DeleteDBCluster and DeleteGlobalCluster events in AWS, or a high quantity of data
deletion events, such as DeleteBucket . Many of these events within a short period of
time may indicate malicious activity.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for binaries that could be involved in data
destruction activity, such as SDelete.
DS0022 File File Deletion Monitor for unexpected deletion to a ﬁle (ex: Sysmon EID 23)
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to a large quantity of ﬁles for unexpected modiﬁcations in
user directories and under C:\Windows\System32.
DS0007 Image Image Deletion Monitor for unexpected deletion of a virtual machine image (ex: Azure Compute Service
Images DELETE)
DS0030 Instance Instance
DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of an instance (ex: instance.delete within GCP Audit
Logs)
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes of binaries that could be involved in data
destruction activity, such as SDelete.
DS0020 Snapshot Snapshot
DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of a snapshot (ex: AWS delete-snapshot)
DS0034 Volume Volume Deletion Monitor for unexpected deletion of a cloud volume (ex: AWS delete-volume)[37][38][39][40][41][42]
