Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Audit images deployed within the environment to ensure they do not contain any malicious
components.
M1035 Limit Access to
Resource Over
NetworkLimit communications with the container service to local Unix sockets or remote access via SSH.
Require secure port access to communicate with the APIs over TLS by disabling unauthenticated
access to the Docker API on port 2375. Instead, communicate with the Docker API over TLS on port
2376.
M1030 Network
SegmentationDeny direct remote access to internal systems through the use of network proxies, gateways, and
ﬁrewalls.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementEnsure containers are not running as root by default. In Kubernetes environments, consider deﬁning
Pod Security Standards that prevent pods from running privileged containers.Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a
public registry. A remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerﬁle that pulls a vanilla base image, such as
alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.
An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2
server, and then they may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image. If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses
will likely not detect the image as malicious since it’s a vanilla image. If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be
considered even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment.[1]
