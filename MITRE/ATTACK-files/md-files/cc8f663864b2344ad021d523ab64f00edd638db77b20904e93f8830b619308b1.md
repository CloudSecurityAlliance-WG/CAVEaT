Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0677 AADInternals AADInternals can execute commands on Azure virtual machines using the VM agent.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has used Azure Run Command and Azure Admin-on-Behalf-of (AOBO) to execute code on virtual
machines.
S1091 Pacu Pacu can run commands on EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Run Command.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementLimit the number of cloud accounts with permissions to remotely execute commands on virtual machines,
and ensure that these are not used for day-to-day operations. In Azure, limit the number of accounts with
the roles Azure Virtual Machine Contributer and above, and consider using temporary Just-in-Time (JIT)
roles to avoid permanently assigning privileged access to virtual machines. In Azure AD, limit the number
of Global and Intune administrators to only those required. In AWS, limit users with permission to execute
the ssm:SendCommand action, and use tags to restrict the number of machines those users can execute
commands on.Adversaries may abuse cloud management services to execute commands within virtual machines or hybrid-joined devices. Resources such
as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines by leveraging
installed virtual machine agents. Similarly, in Azure AD environments, Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows Global or Intune Administrators to
run scripts as SYSTEM on on-premises devices joined to the Azure AD.
If an adversary gains administrative access to a cloud environment, they may be able to abuse cloud management services to execute
commands in the environment’s virtual machines or on-premises hybrid-joined devices. Additionally, an adversary that compromises a
service provider or delegated administrator account may similarly be able to leverage a Trusted Relationship to execute commands in
connected virtual machines.[1][2][3]

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor commands and scripts executed on virtual machines. In Azure, usage of Azure
RunCommand can be identiﬁed via the Azure Activity Logs, and additional details on the
result of executed jobs are available in the
C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows directory on Windows
virtual machines.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor virtual machines for the creation of processes associated with cloud virtual machine
agents. In Windows-based Azure machines, monitor for the WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe
process.
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor commands and scripts executed on virtual machines. In Azure, usage of Azure
RunCommand can be identiﬁed via the Azure Activity Logs, and additional details on the
result of executed jobs are available in the
C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows directory on Windows
virtual machines.
