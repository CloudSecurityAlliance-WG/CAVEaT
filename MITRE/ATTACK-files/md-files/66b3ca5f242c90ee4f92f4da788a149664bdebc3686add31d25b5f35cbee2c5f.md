https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/003/ 3/6Exﬁltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exﬁltration Over
Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol
Adversaries may steal data by exﬁltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control
channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.
Adversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as
HTTP, FTP, or DNS). This may include custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as well as
embedding data within protocol headers and ﬁelds.Other sub-techniques of Exﬁltration Over Alternative Protocol (3)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/003/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0331 Agent Tesla Agent Tesla has routines for exﬁltration over SMTP, FTP, and HTTP.
G0050 APT32 APT32's backdoor can exﬁltrate data by encoding it in the subdomain ﬁeld of DNS packets.
G0064 APT33 APT33 has used FTP to exﬁltrate ﬁles (separately from the C2 channel).
S0190 BITSAdmin BITSAdmin can be used to create BITS Jobs to upload ﬁles from a compromised host.
S0252 Brave Prince Some Brave Prince variants have used South Korea's Daum email service to exﬁltrate information, and later
variants have posted the data to a web server via an HTTP post command.
C0017 C0017 During C0017, APT41 exﬁltrated victim data via DNS lookups by encoding and prepending it as subdomains
to the attacker-controlled domain.
S0335 Carbon Carbon uses HTTP to send data to the C2 server.
S1043 ccf32 ccf32 can upload collected data and ﬁles to an FTP server.
S0674 CharmPower CharmPower can send victim data via FTP with credentials hardcoded in the script.
S0107 Cherry Picker Cherry Picker exﬁltrates ﬁles over FTP.
S0492 CookieMiner CookieMiner has used the curl --upload-file command to exﬁltrate data over HTTP.
S0212 CORALDECK CORALDECK has exﬁltrated data in HTTP POST headers.
S0050 CosmicDuke CosmicDuke exﬁltrates collected ﬁles over FTP or WebDAV. Exﬁltration servers can be separately conﬁgured
from C2 servers.
S0281 Dok Dok exﬁltrates logs of its execution stored in the /tmp folder over FTP using the curl command.
G0037 FIN6 FIN6 has sent stolen payment card data to remote servers via HTTP POSTs.
G0061 FIN8 FIN8 has used FTP to exﬁltrate collected data.
S0095 ftp ftp may be used to exﬁltrate data separate from the main command and control protocol.
S0487 Kessel Kessel can exﬁltrate credentials and other information via HTTP POST request, TCP, and DNS.
S0356 KONNI KONNI has used FTP to exﬁltrate reconnaissance data out.
G0032 Lazarus
GroupLazarus Group malware SierraBravo-Two generates an email message via SMTP containing information
about newly infected victims.
G0049 OilRig OilRig has exﬁltrated data over FTP separately from its primary C2 channel over DNS.
S0428 PoetRAT PoetRAT has used ftp for exﬁltration.
S1040 Rclone Rclone can exﬁltrate data over FTP or HTTP, including HTTP via WebDAV.
S0125 Remsec Remsec can exﬁltrate data via a DNS tunnel or email, separately from its C2 channel.
G0076 Thrip Thrip has used WinSCP to exﬁltrate data from a targeted organization over FTP.
S0466 WindTail WindTail has the ability to automatically exﬁltrate ﬁles using the macOS built-in utility /usr/bin/curl.[2][3][4]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1057 Data Loss
PreventionData loss prevention can detect and block sensitive data being sent over unencrypted protocols.
M1037 Filter Network
TraﬃcEnforce proxies and use dedicated servers for services such as DNS and only allow those systems to
communicate over respective ports/protocols, instead of all systems within a network.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary command and control infrastructure and malware can be used to mitigate activity
at the network level.
M1030 Network
SegmentationFollow best practices for network ﬁrewall conﬁgurations to allow only necessary ports and traﬃc to
enter and exit the network.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may steal data by exﬁltrating it over a
symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and
control channel.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor ﬁles viewed in isolation that may steal data by exﬁltrating it over a
symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and
control channel.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.[32][33]
