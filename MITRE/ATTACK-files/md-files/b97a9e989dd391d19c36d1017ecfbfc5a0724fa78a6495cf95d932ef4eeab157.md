Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0622 AppleSeed AppleSeed has exﬁltrated ﬁles using web services.
G0007 APT28 APT28 can exﬁltrate data over Google Drive.
C0017 C0017 During C0017, APT41 used Cloudﬂare services for data exﬁltration.
S0547 DropBook DropBook has used legitimate web services to exﬁltrate data.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has used the Telegram API sendMessage to relay data on compromised devices.
S0508 ngrok ngrok has been used by threat actors to conﬁgure servers for data exﬁltration.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1057 Data Loss Prevention Data loss prevention can be detect and block sensitive data being uploaded to web services via
web browsers.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of
unauthorized external services.Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exﬁltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.
Popular Web services acting as an exﬁltration mechanism may give a signiﬁcant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a
network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traﬃc to these services.
Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.Sub-techniques (4)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentReview logs for SaaS services, including Oﬃce 365 and Google Workspace, to detect
the conﬁguration of new webhooks or other features that could be abused to exﬁltrate
data.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may use an existing, legitimate
external Web service to exﬁltrate data rather than their primary command and control
channel.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for ﬁles being accessed by an existing, legitimate external Web service to
exﬁltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections to web and cloud services
associated with abnormal or non-browser processes.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s)
that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous
packets that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc
patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring
and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line
arguments associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do
not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
