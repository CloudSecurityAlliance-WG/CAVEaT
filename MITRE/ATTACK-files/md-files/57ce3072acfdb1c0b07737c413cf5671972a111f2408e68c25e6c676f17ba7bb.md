https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/ 3/6Credentials from Password Stores
Adversaries may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords are stored in several places on a
system, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also speciﬁc applications and services that
store passwords to make them easier for users to manage and maintain, such as password managers and cloud secrets vaults. Once
credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.Sub-techniques (6)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1027 Password Policies The password for the user's login keychain can be changed from the user's login password. This
increases the complexity for an adversary because they need to know an additional password.
Organizations may consider weighing the risk of storing credentials in password stores and web
browsers. If system, software, or web browser credential disclosure is a signiﬁcant concern, technical
controls, policy, and user training may be used to prevent storage of credentials in improper locations.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementLimit the number of accounts and services with permission to query information from password stores
to only those required. Ensure that accounts and services with permissions to query password stores
only have access to the secrets they require.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0025 Cloud ServiceCloud Service
EnumerationMonitor for API calls and CLI commands that attempt to enumerate and fetch credential
material from cloud secrets managers, such as get-secret-value in AWS, gcloud
secrets describe in GCP, and az key vault secret show in Azure. Alert on any
suspicious usages of these commands, such as an account or service generating an
unusually high number of secret requests.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may search for common password
storage locations to obtain user credentials.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for ﬁles being accessed that may search for common password storage
locations to obtain user credentials.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may search for common password storage locations to obtain
user credentials.
Process Access Monitor for processes being accessed that may search for common password storage
locations to obtain user credentials.
Process Creation Monitor newly executed processes that may search for common password storage
locations to obtain user credentials.[34]
