Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1039 Bumblebee Bumblebee can use odbcconf.exe to run DLLs on targeted hosts.
G0080 Cobalt Group Cobalt Group has used odbcconf to proxy the execution of malicious DLL ﬁles.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramOdbcconf.exe may not be necessary within a given environment.
M1038 Execution Prevention Use application control conﬁgured to block execution of Odbcconf.exe if it is not required for a
given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads. Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to
conﬁgure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names. The Odbcconf.exe binary may be digitally signed by
Microsoft.
Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse. Similar to
Regsvr32, odbcconf.exe has a REGSVR ﬂag that can be misused to execute DLLs (ex: odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR
"C:\Users\Public\file.dll"} ). Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionCommand arguments used before and after the invocation of odbcconf.exe may also be
useful in determining the origin and purpose of the DLL being loaded.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as the loading of
DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a
process.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of odbcconf.exe. Compare
recent invocations of odbcconf.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded
DLLs to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.
