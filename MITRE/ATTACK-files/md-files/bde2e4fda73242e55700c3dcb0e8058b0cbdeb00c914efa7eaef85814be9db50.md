Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0082 APT38 APT38 has used DYEPACK.FOX to manipulate PDF data as it is accessed to remove traces of fraudulent SWIFT
transactions from the data displayed to the end user.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1030 Network Segmentation Identify critical business and system processes that may be targeted by adversaries and work to
isolate and secure those systems against unauthorized access and tampering.
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsPrevent critical business and system processes from being replaced, overwritten, or reconﬁgured
to load potentially malicious code.Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user, thus threatening the
integrity of the data. By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding,
and decision making.
Adversaries may alter application binaries used to display data in order to cause runtime manipulations. Adversaries may also conduct
Change Default File Association and Masquerading to cause a similar effect. The type of modiﬁcation and the impact it will have depends
on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely
need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged
information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.Other sub-techniques of Data Manipulation (3)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity
File Deletion Monitor for unexpected deletion of a ﬁle in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide
activity
File Metadata Monitor for contextual data about a ﬁle, which may include information such as name, the
content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, etc that would aid in
the manipulation of data to hide activity
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for unexpected ﬁles with manipulated data in order to manipulate external outcomes
or hide activity
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with altering data. Remote access tools with built-in features
may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information.
