Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Oﬃce 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may leverage a
user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network. Adversaries may also access
externally facing Exchange services, Oﬃce 365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. Tools such as
MailSniper can be used to automate searches for speciﬁc keywords.Other sub-techniques of Email Collection (3)

ID Name Description
G0006 APT1 APT1 uses two utilities, GETMAIL and MAPIGET, to steal email. MAPIGET steals email still on Exchange
servers that has not yet been archived.
G0007 APT28 APT28 has collected emails from victim Microsoft Exchange servers.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has collected emails from targeted mailboxes within a compromised Azure AD tenant and
compromised Exchange servers, including via Exchange Web Services (EWS) API requests.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has harvested data from remote mailboxes including through execution of
\\c$\Users\ \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\*.ost .
G0035 Dragonﬂy Dragonﬂy has accessed email accounts using Outlook Web Access.
G0085 FIN4 FIN4 has accessed and hijacked online email communications using stolen credentials.
G0125 HAFNIUM HAFNIUM has used web shells to export mailbox data.
G0004 Ke3chang Ke3chang has used compromised credentials and a .NET tool to dump data from Microsoft Exchange
mailboxes.
G0094 Kimsuky Kimsuky has used tools such as the MailFetch mail crawler to collect victim emails (excluding spam)
from online services via IMAP.
G0077 Leafminer Leafminer used a tool called MailSniper to search through the Exchange server mailboxes for keywords.
S0395 LightNeuron LightNeuron collects Exchange emails matching rules speciﬁed in its conﬁguration.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has exported emails from compromised Exchange servers including through use of the
cmdlet New-MailboxExportRequest.
S0413 MailSniper MailSniper can be used for searching through email in Exchange and Oﬃce 365 environments.
S0053 SeaDuke Some SeaDuke samples have a module to extract email from Microsoft Exchange servers using
compromised credentials.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 collected emails from speciﬁc individuals, such as
executives and IT staff, using New-MailboxExportRequest followed by Get-MailboxExportRequest .
S0476 Valak Valak can collect sensitive mailing information from Exchange servers, including credentials and the
domain certiﬁcate of an enterprise.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationUse of encryption provides an added layer of security to sensitive information sent over email.
Encryption using public key cryptography requires the adversary to obtain the private certiﬁcate along
with an encryption key to decrypt messages.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse of multi-factor authentication for public-facing webmail servers is a recommended best practice
to minimize the usefulness of usernames and passwords to adversaries.[1]
