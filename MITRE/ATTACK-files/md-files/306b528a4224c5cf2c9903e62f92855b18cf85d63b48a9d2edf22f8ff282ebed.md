Establish Accounts: Cloud Accounts
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
Detection
Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection
efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during exﬁltration (ex: Transfer Data to Cloud Account).
ReferencesAdversaries may create accounts with cloud providers that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use cloud accounts to further their
operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, MEGA, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for Exﬁltration to
Cloud Storage or to Upload Tools. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as Virtual Private Servers or
Serverless infrastructure. Establishing cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their
own servers.
Creating Cloud Accounts may also require adversaries to establish Email Accounts to register with the cloud provider.Other sub-techniques of Establish Accounts (3)
