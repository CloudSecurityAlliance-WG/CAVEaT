https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003/ 3/5Phishing: Spearphishing via Service
Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via
service is a speciﬁc variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party
services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.
All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a speciﬁc individual, company, or industry. In this
scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.
These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to
generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message
employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running
in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.
A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on
their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open
the ﬁle since it's something they were expecting. If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal
communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working.Other sub-techniques of Phishing (4)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Anti-virus can also automatically quarantine suspicious ﬁles.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentDetermine if certain social media sites, personal webmail services, or other service that can be
used for spearphishing is necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if
activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a signiﬁcant risk.
M1017 User Training Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing messages with
malicious links.[1]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to
victim systems.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
