Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0658 XCSSET XCSSET uses the plutil command to modify the LSUIElement , DFBundleDisplayName , and
CFBundleIdentifier keys in the /Contents/Info.plist ﬁle to change how XCSSET is visible on the system.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1013 Application Developer
GuidanceEnsure applications are using Apple's developer guidance which enables hardened runtime.Adversaries may modify property list ﬁles (plist ﬁles) to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system
defenses. macOS applications use plist ﬁles, such as the info.plist ﬁle, to store properties and conﬁguration settings that inform the
operating system how to handle the application at runtime. Plist ﬁles are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on
Apple's Core Foundation DTD. Plist ﬁles can be saved in text or binary format.
Adversaries can modify key-value pairs in plist ﬁles to inﬂuence system behaviors, such as hiding the execution of an application (i.e. Hidden
Window) or running additional commands for persistence (ex: Launch Agent/Launch Daemon or Re-opened Applications).
For example, adversaries can add a malicious application path to the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ﬁle, which controls
apps that appear in the Dock. Adversaries can also modify the LSUIElement key in an application’s info.plist ﬁle to run the app in the
background. Adversaries can also insert key-value pairs to insert environment variables, such as LSEnvironment , to enable persistence via
Dynamic Linker Hijacking.[1]

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor for commands with arguments (such as opening common command-line editors)
used to modify plist ﬁles, especially commonly abused ﬁles such as those in
\~/LaunchAgents , \~/Library/Application
Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm , and an
application's Info.plist .
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for plist ﬁle modiﬁcation, especially if immediately followed by other suspicious
events such as code execution from \~/Library/Scripts or \~/Library/Preferences .
Also, monitor for signiﬁcant changes to any path pointers in a modiﬁed plist.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes with arguments that can modify property list (plist)
ﬁles.
