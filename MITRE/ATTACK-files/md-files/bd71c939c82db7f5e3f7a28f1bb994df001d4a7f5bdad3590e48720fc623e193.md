https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001/ 3/7Indicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs
Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and
notiﬁcations. There are three system-deﬁned sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with ﬁve event types: Error, Warning,
Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.
The event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:
wevtutil cl system
wevtutil cl application
wevtutil cl security
These logs may also be cleared through other mechanisms, such as the event viewer GUI or PowerShell. For example, adversaries may use
the PowerShell command Remove-EventLog -LogName Security to delete the Security EventLog and after reboot, disable future logging.
Note: events may still be generated and logged in the .evtx ﬁle between the time the command is run and the reboot.Other sub-techniques of Indicator Removal (9)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationObfuscate/encrypt event ﬁles locally and in transit to avoid giving feedback to an adversary.
M1029 Remote Data
StorageAutomatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the
adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system. When possible, minimize time delay
on event reporting to avoid prolonged storage on the local system.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory
PermissionsProtect generated event ﬁles that are stored locally with proper permissions and authentication and
limit opportunities for adversaries to increase privileges by preventing Privilege Escalation
opportunities.[30]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001/ 6/7Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that would delete Windows event
logs (via PowerShell) such as Remove-EventLog -LogName Security .
Note: Event ID 4104 (from the Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational log) captures
Powershell script blocks, which can be analyzed and used to detect on attempts to Clear
Windows Event Logs. In particular, Powershell has a built-in Clear-EventLog cmdlet that allows
for a speciﬁed log to be cleared.
DS0022 File File Deletion Monitor for unexpected deletion of Windows event logs (via native binaries) and may also
generate an alterable event (Event ID 1102: "The audit log was cleared"). When an eventlog is
cleared, a new event is created that alerts that the eventlog was cleared. For Security logs, its
event code 1100 and 1102. For System logs, it is event code 104.
It is unlikely that event log data would be cleared during normal operations, and it is likely that
malicious attackers may try to cover their tracks by clearing an event log. When an event log
gets cleared, it is suspicious.
1. This is often done using wevtutil, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action
interferes with event collection and notiﬁcation, and may lead to a security event going
undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.
2. Alerting when a Clear Event Log is generated could point to this intruder technique.
Centrally collecting events has the added beneﬁt of making it much harder for attackers
to cover their tracks. Event Forwarding permits sources to forward multiple copies of a
collected event to multiple collectors, thus enabling redundant event collection. Using a
redundant event collection model can minimize the single point of failure risk.
3. Attackers may set the option of the sources of events with Limit-EventLog -LogName
Security -OverflowAction DoNotOverwrite  to not delete old Evenlog when the .evtx
is full. By default the Security Log size is conﬁgured with the minimum value of 20
480KB (~23 000 EventLog). So if this option is enabled, all the new EventLogs will be
automatically deleted. We can detect this behavior with the Security EventLog 1104.
4. Attackers may delete .evtx with del
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\Security.evtx  or Remove-Item
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\Security.evtx  after having disabled and
stopped the Eventlog service. As the EventLog service is disabled and stopped, the .evtx
ﬁles are no longer used by this service and can be deleted. The new EventLog will be
Unavailable until the conﬁguration is reset.
5. Attackers may use the powershell command Remove-EventLog -LogName Security  to
unregister source of events that are part of Windows (Application, Security…). This
command deletes the security EventLog (which also generates EventId 1102) but the
new Eventlogs are still recorded until the system is rebooted . After the System is
rebooted, the Security log is unregistered and doesn’t log any new Eventlog. However
logs generated between the command and the reboot are still available in the .evtx ﬁle.

Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity
of an intrusion. In an attempt to clear traces after compromising a machine, threat actors
often try to clear Windows Event logs. This is often done using "wevtutil", a legitimate tool
provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notiﬁcation, and may
lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of
the network.
