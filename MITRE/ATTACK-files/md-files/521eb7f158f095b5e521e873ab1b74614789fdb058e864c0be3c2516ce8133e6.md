Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution
PreventionUse application controls to mitigate installation and use of payloads that may be utilized to spoof
security alerting.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0009 Process Process
CreationConsider monitoring for suspicious processes that may be spooﬁng security tools and
monitoring messages.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Monitor logging, messaging, and other artifacts highlighting the health of host sensors
(e.g., metrics, errors, and/or exceptions from logging applications), especially correlating
and comparing centralized telemetry against potentially suspicious notiﬁcations presented
on individual systems.
ReferencesAdversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders’ awareness of malicious activity.
Messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events as well as the functioning status of security
software and the system. Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying
important events that can signal a security incident.
Rather than or in addition to Indicator Blocking, an adversary can spoof positive aﬃrmations that security tools are continuing to function
even after legitimate security tools have been disabled (e.g., Disable or Modify Tools). An adversary can also present a "healthy" system
status even after infection. This can be abused to enable further malicious activity by delaying defender responses.
For example, adversaries may show a fake Windows Security GUI and tray icon with a "healthy" system status after Windows Defender and
other system tools have been disabled.Other sub-techniques of Impair Defenses (11)
