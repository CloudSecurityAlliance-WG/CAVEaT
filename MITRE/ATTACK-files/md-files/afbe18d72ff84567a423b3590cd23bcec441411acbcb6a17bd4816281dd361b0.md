https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/ 3/5Brute Force: Password Spraying
Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid
account credentials. Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may
match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid
account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords. 
Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the
following:
SSH (22/TCP)
Telnet (23/TCP)
FTP (21/TCP)
NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
LDAP (389/TCP)
Kerberos (88/TCP)
RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
MSSQL (1433/TCP)
Oracle (1521/TCP)
MySQL (3306/TCP)
VNC (5900/TCP)
In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated
authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Oﬃce 365.
In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon
failure" event ID 4625.Other sub-techniques of Brute Force (4)

ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 has used a brute-force/password-spray tooling that operated in two modes: in password-spraying
mode it conducted approximately four authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the
course of several days or weeks. APT28 has also used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed, large-
scale password spray attacks.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has conducted brute force password spray attacks.
G0064 APT33 APT33 has used password spraying to gain access to target systems.
S0606 Bad Rabbit Bad Rabbit’s infpub.dat ﬁle uses NTLM login credentials to brute force Windows machines.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has used multiple password spraying attacks against victim's remote services to obtain valid user
and administrator accounts.
S0488 CrackMapExec CrackMapExec can brute force credential authentication by using a supplied list of usernames and a single
password.
G1001 HEXANE HEXANE has used password spraying attacks to obtain valid credentials.
G0032 Lazarus Group Lazarus Group malware attempts to connect to Windows shares for lateral movement by using a generated
list of usernames, which center around permutations of the username Administrator, and weak passwords.
G0077 Leafminer Leafminer used a tool called Total SMB BruteForcer to perform internal password spraying.
S0362 Linux Rabbit Linux Rabbit brute forces SSH passwords in order to attempt to gain access and install its malware onto the
server. 
S0413 MailSniper MailSniper can be used for password spraying against Exchange and Oﬃce 365.
G0122 Silent
LibrarianSilent Librarian has used collected lists of names and e-mail accounts to use in password spraying attacks
against private sector targets.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1036 Account Use
PoliciesSet account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from
being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-
usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to
block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside deﬁned organization IP ranges.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally
facing services.
M1027 Password
PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies. [3][4]

DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationMonitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may
result from password spraying attempts.
