Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1060 Mafalda Mafalda can use port-knocking to authenticate itself to another implant called Cryshell to establish an
indirect connection to the C2 server.
S1059 metaMain metaMain has authenticated itself to a different implant, Cryshell, through a port knocking and handshake
procedure.
G0056 PROMETHIUM PROMETHIUM has used a script that conﬁgures the knockd service and ﬁrewall to only accept C2
connections from systems that use a speciﬁed sequence of knock ports.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1037 Filter Network
TraﬃcMitigation of some variants of this technique could be achieved through the use of stateful ﬁrewalls,
depending upon how it is implemented.Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a
series of attempted connections to a predeﬁned sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often
accomplished by the host based ﬁrewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.
This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening
server on a different system.
The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally
implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which
enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.Other sub-techniques of Traﬃc Signaling (2)

DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor and analyze network ﬂows associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the
expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not
belong to established ﬂows, or gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns). Consider
analyzing newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted
hosts, unexpcted hardware devices, or other uncommon data ﬂows.
