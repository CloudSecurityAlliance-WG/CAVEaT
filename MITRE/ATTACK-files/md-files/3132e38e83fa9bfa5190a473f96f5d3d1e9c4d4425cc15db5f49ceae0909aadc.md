Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0001 Axiom Axiom has used spear phishing to initially compromise victims.
G0115 GOLD
SOUTHFIELDGOLD SOUTHFIELD has conducted malicious spam (malspam) campaigns to gain access to victim's
machines.
S0009 Hikit Hikit has been spread through spear phishing.
S1073 Royal Royal has been spread through the use of phishing campaigns including "call back phishing" where
victims are lured into calling a number provided through email.Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social
engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a speciﬁc individual, company, or industry will be targeted
by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.
Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems.
Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering
techniques, such as posing as a trusted source, as well as evasive techniques such as removing or manipulating emails or
metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages (e.g., Email Hiding Rules). Another way to accomplish
this is by forging or spooﬁng the identity of the sender which can be used to fool both the human recipient as well as automated security
tools.
Victims may also receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number where they are directed to visit a malicious URL,
download malware, or install adversary-accessible remote management tools onto their computer (i.e., User Execution).Sub-techniques (4)

ID Mitigation Description
M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Anti-virus can automatically quarantine suspicious ﬁles.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious email
attachments or links can be used to block activity.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentDetermine if certain websites or attachment types (ex: .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc.) that can be used for
phishing are necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be
monitored well or if it poses a signiﬁcant risk.
M1054 Software Conﬁguration Use anti-spooﬁng and email authentication mechanisms to ﬁlter messages based on validity
checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these
mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients
(intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message ﬁltering and validation.
M1017 User Training Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and phishing emails.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. Filtering based on DKIM+SPF
or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed. URL
inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can help detect links
leading to known malicious sites. Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links
and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or
wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.
Monitor call logs from corporate devices to identify patterns of potential voice phishing,
such as calls to/from known malicious phone numbers. Correlate these records with
system events.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles from a phishing messages to gain access to victim
systems.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze SSL/TLS traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to
protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g
extraneous packets that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous
traﬃc patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process
monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command
line arguments associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that
do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)). Filtering based on
DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.[14][15]
