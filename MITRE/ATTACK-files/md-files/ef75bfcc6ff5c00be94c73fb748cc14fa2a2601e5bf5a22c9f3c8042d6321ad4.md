https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008/ 3/7Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows
contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the
Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without
logging in to the system.
Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe , launched when the shift key is pressed ﬁve times and
C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe , launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred
to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. 
Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways. Common methods used by
adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry. In newer versions of
Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\ , and it must be protected
by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). The Image File Execution Options Injection debugger method was likely discovered
as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.
For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g.,
C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe ) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently,
pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol
will cause the replaced ﬁle to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. 
Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: 
On-Screen Keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
Magniﬁer: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
Display Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
App Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exeOther sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution
PreventionAdversaries can replace accessibility features binaries with alternate binaries to execute this
technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software executed through accessibility features
functionality by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control,
AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. 
M1035 Limit Access to
Resource Over
NetworkIf possible, use a Remote Desktop Gateway to manage connections and security conﬁguration of RDP
within a network.
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationTo use this technique remotely, an adversary must use it in conjunction with RDP. Ensure that Network
Level Authentication is enabled to force the remote desktop session to authenticate before the session
is created and the login screen displayed. It is enabled by default on Windows Vista and later.[5][6]

Command line invocation of tools capable of modifying the Registry for associated
keys are also suspicious. Utility arguments and the binaries themselves should be
monitored for changes.
Note: Event ID 4104 (from the Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational log)
captures Powershell script blocks, which can be analyzed and used to detect on abuse
of Accessibility Features.

CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence and/or elevate
privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.
An adversary can use accessibility features (Ease of Access), such as StickyKeys or
Utilman, to launch a command shell from the logon screen and gain SYSTEM access.
Since an adversary does not have physical access to the machine, this technique must
be run within Remote Desktop. To prevent an adversary from getting to the login
screen without ﬁrst authenticating, Network-Level Authentication (NLA) must be
enabled. If a debugger is set up for one of the accessibility features, then it will
intercept the process launch of the feature and instead execute a new command line.
This analytic looks for instances of cmd.exe or powershell.exe launched directly from
the logon process, winlogon.exe.
Several accessibility programs can be run using the Ease of Access center
sethc.exe handles StickyKeys
utilman.exe is the Ease of Access menu
osk.exe runs the On-Screen Keyboard
narrator.exe reads screen text over audio
magnify.exe magniﬁes the view of the screen near the cursor
One simple way to implement this technique is to note that in a default Windows
conﬁguration there are no spaces in the path to the system32 folder. If the
accessibility programs are ever run with a Debugger set, then Windows will launch the
Debugger process and append the command line to the accessibility program. As a
result, a space is inserted in the command line before the path. Looking for any
instances of a space in the command line before the name of an accessibility
program will help identify when Debuggers are set.
The Windows Registry location HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options allows for parameters to be set for
applications during execution. One feature used by malicious actors is the "Debugger"
option. When a key has this value enabled, a Debugging command line can be
speciﬁed. Windows will launch the Debugging command line, and pass the original
command line in as an argument. Adversaries can set a Debugger for Accessibility
Applications. The analytic looks for the original command line as an argument to the
Debugger. When the strings "sethc.exe", "utilman.exe", "osk.exe", "narrator.exe", and
"Magnify.exe" are detected in the arguments, but not as the main executable, it is very
likely that a Debugger is set.
Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security
Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic example looks for
any creation of common accessibility processes such as sethc.exe but does no other
ﬁltering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any
such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the parent
process) that helps reduce false positives.
Analytic 2 could depend on the possibility of the known strings used as arguments for
other applications used in the day-to-day environment. Although the chance of the
string "sethc.exe" being used as an argument for another application is unlikely, it still
is a possibility.
