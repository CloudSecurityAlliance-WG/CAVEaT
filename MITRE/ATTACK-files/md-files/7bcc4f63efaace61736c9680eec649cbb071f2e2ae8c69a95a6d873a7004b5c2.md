https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496/ 3/6Resource Hijacking
Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted
service availability.
One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries
may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive. Servers and
cloud-based systems are common targets because of the high potential for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be
compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining. Containerized environments may also be targeted due to the
ease of deployment via exposed APIs and the potential for scaling mining activities by deploying or compromising multiple containers
within an environment or cluster.
Additionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing malware to ensure it’s not competing for
resources.
Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate Network Denial of
Service campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents. Alternatively, they may engage in proxyjacking by selling use of the victims' network
bandwidth and IP address to proxyware services.[1]

ID Name Description
G0096 APT41 APT41 deployed a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool in a victim’s environment.
G0108 Blue
MockingbirdBlue Mockingbird has used XMRIG to mine cryptocurrency on victim systems.
S0486 Bonadan Bonadan can download an additional module which has a cryptocurrency mining extension.
S0492 CookieMiner CookieMiner has loaded coinmining software onto systems to mine for Koto cryptocurrency. 
S0601 Hildegard Hildegard has used xmrig to mine cryptocurrency.
S0434 Imminent
MonitorImminent Monitor has the capability to run a cryptocurrency miner on the victim machine.
S0599 Kinsing Kinsing has created and run a Bitcoin cryptocurrency miner.
S0451 LoudMiner LoudMiner harvested system resources to mine cryptocurrency, using XMRig to mine Monero.
S0532 Lucifer Lucifer can use system resources to mine cryptocurrency, dropping XMRig to mine Monero.
G0106 Rocke Rocke has distributed cryptomining malware.
S0468 Skidmap Skidmap is a kernel-mode rootkit used for cryptocurrency mining.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has deployed XMRig Docker images to mine cryptocurrency. TeamTNT has also infected
Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters with XMRig, and used RainbowMiner and lolMiner for mining
cryptocurrency.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.[8]

CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts, look for connections to/from strange ports, as well as reputation of IPs

FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that
do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for common cryptomining or proxyware software process names that may
indicate compromise and resource usage.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Consider monitoring process resource usage to determine anomalous activity
associated with malicious hijacking of computer resources such as CPU, memory, and
graphics processing resources.3/22/24, 3:53 PM Resource Hijacking, Technique T1496 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
