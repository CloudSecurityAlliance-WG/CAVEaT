https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003/ 3/4Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo and Sudo
Caching
Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers ﬁle to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as
other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.
Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as "superuser do") allows users to perform commands from terminals with
elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The sudo command "allows a system administrator to
delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing
an audit trail of the commands and their arguments." Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful conﬁguration
features such as a timestamp\_timeout , which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a
password. This is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a ﬁle at /var/db/sudo
with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a tty\_tickets variable that treats each new tty
(terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the
password again).
The sudoers ﬁle, /etc/sudoers , describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which
commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest
possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password.
However, the sudoers ﬁle can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL .
Elevated privileges are required to edit this ﬁle though.
Adversaries can also abuse poor conﬁgurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For
example, /var/db/sudo 's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp\_timeout range. If it does, then malware can
execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if tty\_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this
from any tty for that user.
In the wild, malware has disabled tty\_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty\_tickets\' >>
/etc/sudoers . In order for this change to be reﬂected, the malware also issued killall Terminal . As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers ﬁle
has tty\_tickets enabled by default.Other sub-techniques of Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (5)

ID Name Description
S0154 Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike can use sudo to run a command.
S0281 Dok Dok adds admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL to the /etc/sudoers ﬁle.
S0279 Proton Proton modiﬁes the tty\_tickets line in the sudoers ﬁle.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationEnsuring that the tty\_tickets setting is enabled will prevent this leakage across tty sessions.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementBy requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the
password to run anything in the sudoers ﬁle. Setting the timestamp\_timeout to 0 will require the
user to input their password every time sudo is executed.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory PermissionsThe sudoers ﬁle should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users
can't spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may perform sudo caching and/or use the
suoders ﬁle to elevate privileges, such as the sudo command.
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationOn Linux, auditd can alert every time a user's actual ID and effective ID are different (this is
what happens when you sudo). This technique is abusing normal functionality in macOS and
Linux systems, but sudo has the ability to log all input and output based on the LOG\_INPUT
and LOG\_OUTPUT directives in the /etc/sudoers ﬁle.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may perform sudo caching and/or use the suoders
ﬁle to elevate privileges.
Process
MetadataMonitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as
environment variables, image name, user/owner that may perform sudo caching and/or use
the suoders ﬁle to elevate privileges.
