Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0687 Cyclops
BlinkCyclops Blink has the ability to create a pipe to enable inter-process communication.
S0537 HyperStack HyperStack can connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines.
S1078 RotaJakiro When executing with non-root permissions, RotaJakiro uses the the shmget API to create shared memory
between other known RotaJakiro processes. This allows processes to communicate with each other and share
their PID.
S0022 Uroburos Uroburos has the ability to move data between its kernel and user mode components, generally using named
pipes.Adversaries may abuse inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms for local code or command execution. IPC is typically used by
processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution. IPC is also commonly used to avoid situations such as
deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern.
Adversaries may abuse IPC to execute arbitrary code or commands. IPC mechanisms may differ depending on OS, but typically exists in a
form accessible through programming languages/libraries or native interfaces such as Windows Dynamic Data Exchange or Component
Object Model. Linux environments support several different IPC mechanisms, two of which being sockets and pipes. Higher level execution
mediums, such as those of Command and Scripting Interpreters, may also leverage underlying IPC mechanisms. Adversaries may also use
Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model to facilitate remote IPC execution.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1013 Application Developer
GuidanceEnable the Hardened Runtime capability when developing applications. Do not include the
com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.
M1048 Application Isolation
and SandboxingEnsure all COM alerts and Protected View are enabled.
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent DDE attacks and spawning
of child processes from Oﬃce programs.
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramRegistry keys speciﬁc to Microsoft Oﬃce feature control security can be set to disable automatic
DDE/OLE execution. Microsoft also created, and enabled by default, Registry keys to
completely disable DDE execution in Word and Excel.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementModify Registry settings (directly or using Dcomcnfg.exe) in
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\AppID\\{AppID\_GUID} associated with the process-
wide security of individual COM applications.
Modify Registry settings (directly or using Dcomcnfg.exe) in
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Ole associated with system-wide security
defaults for all COM applications that do no set their own process-wide security. 
M1054 Software
ConﬁgurationConsider disabling embedded ﬁles in Oﬃce programs, such as OneNote, that do not work with
Protected View.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as the loading of
DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a
process.
DS0009 Process Process
AccessMonitor for processes making abnormal calls to higher privileged processes, such as a user
application connecting to a VPN service.
Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that are associated with abuse of IPC mechanisms
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of
cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be
captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and intent.[7]
