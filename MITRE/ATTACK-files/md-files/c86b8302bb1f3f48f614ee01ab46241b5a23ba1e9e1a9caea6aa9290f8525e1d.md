https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001/ 3/5Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and
SMB Relay
By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traﬃc, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force
communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.
Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as
alternate methods of host identiﬁcation. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local
link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identiﬁes systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. 
Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP
137) traﬃc as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the
adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identiﬁcation/authentication, the username and
NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire
through tools that monitor the ports for traﬃc or through Network Sniﬃng and crack the hashes oﬄine through Brute Force to obtain the
plaintext passwords.
In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans
that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to
access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of
it. Additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB, MSSQL and HTTP, to
expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response. 
Several tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and Responder.Other sub-techniques of Adversary-in-the-Middle (3)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0363 Empire Empire can use Inveigh to conduct name service poisoning for credential theft and associated relay attacks.
S0357 Impacket Impacket modules like ntlmrelayx and smbrelayx can be used in conjunction with Network Sniﬃng and
LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to gather NetNTLM credentials for Brute Force or relay attacks that
can gain code execution.
G0032 Lazarus
GroupLazarus Group executed Responder using the command [Responder file path] -i [IP address] -rPv
on a compromised host to harvest credentials and move laterally.
S0378 PoshC2 PoshC2 can use Inveigh to conduct name service poisoning for credential theft and associated relay attacks.
S0192 Pupy Pupy can sniff plaintext network credentials and use NBNS Spooﬁng to poison name services.
S0174 Responder Responder is used to poison name services to gather hashes and credentials from systems within a local
network.
G0102 Wizard
SpiderWizard Spider has used the Invoke-Inveigh PowerShell cmdlets, likely for name service poisoning.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramDisable LLMNR and NetBIOS in local computer security settings or by group policy if they are
not needed within an environment. 
M1037 Filter Network Traﬃc Use host-based security software to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traﬃc. Enabling SMB Signing can
stop NTLMv2 relay attacks.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traﬃc patterns indicative
of AiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
M1030 Network Segmentation Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require
broad network access. This may mitigate, or at least alleviate, the scope of AiTM activity.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor for traﬃc on ports UDP 5355 and UDP 137 if LLMNR/NetBIOS is disabled
by security policy.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor for network traﬃc originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.
Local network traﬃc metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage
of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying
hardware.
DS0019 Service Service Creation Monitor for newly constructed services/daemons through Windows event logs for
event IDs 4697 and 7045. Deploy an LLMNR/NBT-NS spooﬁng detection tool.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationMonitor HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient for changes
to the "EnableMulticast" DWORD value. A value of "0" indicates LLMNR is disabled.[8]
