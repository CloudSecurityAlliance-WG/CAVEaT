Order Hijacking
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0363 Empire Empire contains modules that can discover and exploit search order hijacking vulnerabilities.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit contains a collection of Privesc-PowerUp modules that can discover and exploit search order
hijacking vulnerabilities.Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs
do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own ﬁle in the directory where the calling program is located,
causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.
Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike
DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. However, it is
common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An
adversary who ﬁnds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may
take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly speciﬁed program and placing it within the initiating
program's directory.
For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument net user . An adversary may place a program called "net.exe"
within the same directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a
program called "net.com" in the same directory as "net.exe", then cmd.exe /C net user will execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to
the order of executable extensions deﬁned under PATHEXT. 
Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in DLL Search Order Hijacking.Other sub-techniques of Hijack Execution Flow (12)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Find and eliminate path interception weaknesses in program conﬁguration ﬁles, scripts, the PATH
environment variable, services, and in shortcuts by surrounding PATH variables with quotation marks
when functions allow for them. Be aware of the search order Windows uses for executing or loading
binaries and use fully qualiﬁed paths wherever appropriate.
Clean up old Windows Registry keys when software is uninstalled to avoid keys with no associated
legitimate binaries. Periodically search for and correct or report path interception weaknesses on
systems that may have been introduced using custom or available tools that report software using
insecure path conﬁgurations.
M1038 Execution
PreventionAdversaries will likely need to place new binaries in locations to be executed through this weakness.
Identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application
control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies
where appropriate.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory
PermissionsEnsure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write
ﬁles to the top-level directory C: and system directories, such as C:\Windows\ , to reduce places where
malicious ﬁles could be placed for execution. Require that all executables be placed in write-protected
directories.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor ﬁle creation for ﬁles named after partial directories and in locations that may be
searched for common processes through the environment variable, or otherwise should not be
user writable. Also, monitor ﬁle creation for programs that are named after Windows system
programs or programs commonly executed without a path (such as "ﬁndstr," "net," and
"python"). If this activity occurs outside of known administration activity, upgrades,
installations, or patches, then it may be suspicious.
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for programs metadata modiﬁcations such as deletion of the path to an executable
since it makes programs vulnerable to this type of technique. Also, monitor modiﬁcations of
ﬁles such as renaming programs using Windows system utilities names.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes for process executable paths that are named for partial
directories.[1][8][9]
