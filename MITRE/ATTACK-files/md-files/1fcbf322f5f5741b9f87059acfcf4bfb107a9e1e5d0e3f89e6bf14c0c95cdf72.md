Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0108 Blue
MockingbirdBlue Mockingbird has used wmic.exe and Windows Registry modiﬁcations to set the COR\_PROFILER
environment variable to execute a malicious DLL whenever a process loads the .NET CLR.
S1066 DarkTortilla DarkTortilla can detect proﬁlers by verifying the COR\_ENABLE\_PROFILING environment variable is present
and active.Adversaries may leverage the COR\_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution ﬂow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The
COR\_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) proﬁling DLL to be
loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These proﬁlers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and
debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.
The COR\_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of inﬂuence.
System and user-wide environment variable scopes are speciﬁed in the Registry, where a Component Object Model (COM) object can be
registered as a proﬁler DLL. A process scope COR\_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry. Starting with
.NET Framework 4, the proﬁling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is speciﬁed in the
COR\_PROFILER\_PATH environment variable.
Adversaries may abuse COR\_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every
time the CLR is invoked. The COR\_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: Bypass User Account Control) if the victim .NET
process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses provided by .NET processes.Other sub-techniques of Hijack Execution Flow (12)

ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution
PreventionIdentify and block potentially malicious unmanaged COR\_PROFILER proﬁling DLLs by using
application control solutions like AppLocker that are capable of auditing and/or blocking unapproved
DLLs.
M1024 Restrict Registry
PermissionsEnsure proper permissions are set for Registry hives to prevent users from modifying keys associated
with COR\_PROFILER.
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit the privileges of user accounts so that only authorized administrators can edit system
environment variables.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionExtra scrutiny should be placed on suspicious modiﬁcation of Registry keys such
as COR\_ENABLE\_PROFILING, COR\_PROFILER, and COR\_PROFILER\_PATH by
command line tools like wmic.exe, setx.exe, and Reg. Monitoring for command-line
arguments indicating a change to COR\_PROFILER variables may aid in detection.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL ﬁles that are associated with COR\_PROFILER environment variables.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for newly executed processes, such as setx.exe, that may abuse of the
COR\_PROFILER variable, monitor for new suspicious unmanaged proﬁling DLLs
loading into .NET processes shortly after the CLR causing abnormal process
behavior.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationFor detecting system and user scope abuse of the COR\_PROFILER variable, monitor
the Registry for changes to COR\_ENABLE\_PROFILING, COR\_PROFILER, and
COR\_PROFILER\_PATH that correspond to system and user environment variables
that do not correlate to known developer tools.
