Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
C0025 2016 Ukraine
Electric Power
AttackDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used a trojanized version of Windows
Notepad to add a layer of persistence for Industroyer.
S0486 Bonadan Bonadan has maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.
S0377 Ebury Ebury has been embedded into modiﬁed OpenSSH binaries to gain persistent access to SSH credential
information.
S0604 Industroyer Industroyer has used a Trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application for an additional backdoor
persistence mechanism.
S0487 Kessel Kessel has maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.
S0641 Kobalos Kobalos replaced the SSH client with a trojanized SSH client to steal credentials on compromised
systems.
S0595 ThiefQuest ThiefQuest searches through the /Users/ folder looking for executable ﬁles. For each executable,
ThiefQuest prepends a copy of itself to the beginning of the ﬁle. When the ﬁle is executed, the ThiefQuest
code is executed ﬁrst. ThiefQuest creates a hidden ﬁle, copies the original target executable to the ﬁle,
then executes the new hidden ﬁle to maintain the appearance of normal behavior. 
S0658 XCSSET XCSSET uses a malicious browser application to replace the legitimate browser in order to continuously
capture credentials, monitor web traﬃc, and download additional modules.Adversaries may modify client software binaries to establish persistent access to systems. Client software enables users to access services
provided by a server. Common client software types are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, and web browsers.
Adversaries may make modiﬁcations to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those applications are in use. For
example, an adversary may copy source code for the client software, add a backdoor, compile for the target, and replace the legitimate
application binary (or support ﬁles) with the backdoored one. An adversary may also modify an existing binary by patching in malicious
functionality (e.g., IAT Hooking/Entry point patching) prior to the binary’s legitimate execution. For example, an adversary may modify the
entry point of a binary to point to malicious code patched in by the adversary before resuming normal execution ﬂow.
Since these applications may be routinely executed by the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host.[1]
