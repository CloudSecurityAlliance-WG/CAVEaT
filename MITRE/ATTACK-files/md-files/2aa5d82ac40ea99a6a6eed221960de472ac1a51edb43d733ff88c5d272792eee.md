Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0114 Chimera Chimera has used credential stuﬃng against victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts.
S0266 TrickBot TrickBot uses brute-force attack against RDP with rdpscanDll module.Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential
overlap. Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the
user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking
advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.
Credential stuﬃng is a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the
organization's login failure policies.
Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when stuﬃng credentials. Commonly targeted services include the
following:
SSH (22/TCP)
Telnet (23/TCP)
FTP (21/TCP)
NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
LDAP (389/TCP)
Kerberos (88/TCP)
RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
MSSQL (1433/TCP)
Oracle (1521/TCP)
MySQL (3306/TCP)
VNC (5900/TCP)
In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated
authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Oﬃce 365.Other sub-techniques of Brute Force (4)

ID Mitigation Description
M1036 Account Use
PoliciesSet account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from
being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-
usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to
block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside deﬁned organization IP ranges.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally
facing services.
M1027 Password
PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies. 
M1018 User Account
ManagementProactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after
detecting bruteforce attempts.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of Valid
Accounts. If authentication failures are high, then there may be a brute force attempt
to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationMonitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may
result from credential stuﬃng attempts.
