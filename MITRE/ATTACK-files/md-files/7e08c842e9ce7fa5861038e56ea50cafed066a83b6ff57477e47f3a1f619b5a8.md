https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/ 3/8External Remote Services
Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs,
Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often
remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as Windows Remote
Management and VNC can also be used externally.
Access to Valid Accounts to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the
credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network. Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent
access mechanism during an operation.
Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include
an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.[1]

S1060 Mafalda Mafalda can establish an SSH connection from a compromised host to a server.
C0002 Night Dragon During Night Dragon, threat actors used compromised VPN accounts to gain access to victim systems.
G0049 OilRig OilRig uses remote services such as VPN, Citrix, or OWA to persist in an environment.
C0012 Operation
CuckooBeesDuring Operation CuckooBees, the threat actors enabled WinRM over HTTP/HTTPS as a backup
persistence mechanism using the following command: cscript //nologo
"C:\Windows\System32\winrm.vbs" set
winrm/config/service@{EnableCompatibilityHttpsListener="true"} .
C0014 Operation Wocao During Operation Wocao, threat actors used stolen credentials to connect to the victim's network via
VPN.

persistence within the target network. Sandworm Team has also used VPN tunnels established in
legitimate software company infrastructure to gain access to internal networks of that software
company's users.

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentWhen authentication is not required to access an exposed remote service, monitor for
follow-on activities such as anomalous external use of the exposed API or application.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
MetadataFollow best practices for detecting adversary use of Valid Accounts for authenticating
to remote services. Collect authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns,
windows of activity, and access outside of normal business hours.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that may use Valid Accounts to
access and/or persist within a network using External Remote Services. Use of External
Remote Services may be legitimate depending on the environment and how it’s used.
Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may
indicate suspicious or malicious behavior using External Remote Services.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s)
that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous
packets that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc
patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring
and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line
arguments associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do
not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor for network traﬃc originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.
Local network traﬃc metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of
network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.3/22/24, 3:35 PM External Remote Services, Technique T1133 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
