https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002/ 3/6Inter-Process Communication: Dynamic Data Exchange
Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time
and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously
exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notiﬁcations when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of
changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.
Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being
superseded by Component Object Model, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Oﬃce 2016 via Registry keys.
Microsoft Oﬃce documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded ﬁles, and used to deliver execution via
Phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. Similarly, adversaries
may infect payloads to execute applications and/or commands on a victim device by way of embedding DDE formulas within a CSV ﬁle
intended to be opened through a Windows spreadsheet program.
DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a Command and
Scripting Interpreter. DDE execution can be invoked remotely via Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).Other sub-techniques of Inter-Process Communication (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1048 Application Isolation
and SandboxingEnsure Protected View is enabled.
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent DDE attacks and
spawning of child processes from Oﬃce programs.
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramRegistry keys speciﬁc to Microsoft Oﬃce feature control security can be set to disable automatic
DDE/OLE execution. Microsoft also created, and enabled by default, Registry keys to
completely disable DDE execution in Word and Excel.
M1054 Software
ConﬁgurationConsider disabling embedded ﬁles in Oﬃce programs, such as OneNote, that do not work with
Protected View.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor processes for abnormal behavior indicative of DDE abuse, such as Microsoft Oﬃce
applications loading DLLs and other modules not typically associated with the application or
these applications spawning unusual processes (such as cmd.exe).
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
to execute arbitrary commands. Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous
inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established,

DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. OLE and Oﬃce Open XML ﬁles can be scanned for ‘DDEAUTO', ‘DDE’, and other
strings indicative of DDE execution.https://blog.nviso.be/2017/10/11/detecting-dde-in-ms-
