https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002/ 3/6OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager
Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory
techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database ﬁle that contains local accounts for
the host, typically those found with the net user command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.
A number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM ﬁle through in-memory techniques:
pwdumpx.exe
gsecdump
Mimikatz
secretsdump.py
Alternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:
reg save HKLM\sam sam
reg save HKLM\system system
Creddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.
Notes:
RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.
RID 501 is the guest account.
User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.Other sub-techniques of OS Credential Dumping (8)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationConsider disabling or restricting NTLM.
M1027 Password Policies Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the
network.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementDo not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless
they are tightly controlled, as this is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the
same password on all systems. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise
network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.
M1017 User Training Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use
the same password for multiple accounts.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to extract credential
material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-
memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is
stored.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for hash dumpers opening the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on the
local ﬁle system (%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM ). Some hash dumpers will
open the local ﬁle system as a device and parse to the SAM table to avoid ﬁle access
defenses. Others will make an in-memory copy of the SAM table before reading
hashes. Detection of compromised Valid Accounts in-use by adversaries may help as
well.
File Creation Monitor newly constructed ﬁles being written with default names that have extracted
credentials from the Security Account Manager.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
AccessMonitor for the SAM registry key dump being created to access stored account
password hashes. Some hash dumpers will open the local ﬁle system as a device
and parse to the SAM table to avoid ﬁle access defenses. Others will make an in-
memory copy of the SAM table before reading hashes. Detection of compromised
Valid Accounts in-use by adversaries may help as well.[30]
