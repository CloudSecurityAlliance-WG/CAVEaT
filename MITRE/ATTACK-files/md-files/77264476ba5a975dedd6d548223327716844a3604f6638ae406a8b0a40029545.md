Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0082 APT38 APT38 has used CHM ﬁles to move concealed payloads.
G0096 APT41 APT41 used compiled HTML (.chm) ﬁles for targeting.
S0373 Astaroth Astaroth uses ActiveX objects for ﬁle execution and manipulation. 
G0070 Dark
CaracalDark Caracal leveraged a compiled HTML ﬁle that contained a command to download and run an executable.
G0049 OilRig OilRig has used a CHM payload to load and execute another malicious ﬁle once delivered to a victim.
G0091 Silence Silence has weaponized CHM ﬁles in their phishing campaigns.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution
PreventionConsider using application control to prevent execution of hh.exe if it is not required for a given
system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentConsider blocking download/transfer and execution of potentially uncommon ﬁle types known to be
used in adversary campaigns, such as CHM ﬁlesAdversaries may abuse Compiled HTML ﬁles (.chm) to conceal malicious code. CHM ﬁles are commonly distributed as part of the Microsoft
HTML Help system. CHM ﬁles are compressed compilations of various content such as HTML documents, images, and scripting/web
related programming languages such VBA, JScript, Java, and ActiveX. CHM content is displayed using underlying components of the
Internet Explorer browser loaded by the HTML Help executable program (hh.exe). 
A custom CHM ﬁle containing embedded payloads could be delivered to a victim then triggered by User Execution. CHM execution may also
bypass application application control on older and/or unpatched systems that do not account for execution of binaries through hh.exe. Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may forge SAML tokens with any
permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certiﬁcate.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor presence and use of CHM ﬁles, especially if they are not typically used within an
environment.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor and analyze the execution and arguments of hh.exe. Compare recent invocations
of hh.exe with prior history of known good arguments to determine anomalous and potentially
adversarial activity (ex: obfuscated and/or malicious commands). Non-standard process
execution trees may also indicate suspicious or malicious behavior, such as if hh.exe is the
parent process for suspicious processes and activity relating to other adversarial techniques.
Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event
ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for the creation of any HTML
Help Executable ( hh.exe ) processes. Adversaries may hide malicious code in .chm
compiled help ﬁles; whenever a user tries to open one of these ﬁles, Windows executes the
HTML Help Executable. Therefore, if there are legitimate uses of compiled help ﬁles in your
environment, this analytic may lead to false positives and will require additional tuning.
Analytic 1 - Compiled HTML Access
processes = filter processes where ((event\_id == "1" OR event\_id == "4688")
AND exe="C:\Windows\syswow64\hh.exe" OR exe="C:\Windows\system32\hh.exe")
