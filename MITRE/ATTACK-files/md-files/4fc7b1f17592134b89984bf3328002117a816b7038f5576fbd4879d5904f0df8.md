https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/ 3/5Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket
Adversaries may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access
controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's
password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the ﬁrst step to lateral movement to a remote system.
When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for Valid Accounts are captured by OS Credential Dumping. A user's service tickets or ticket
granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas
a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.
A Silver Ticket can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access
that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).
A Golden Ticket can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables
generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.
Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example,
"overpassing the hash" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e. Pass the Hash) while also using the password
hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.Other sub-techniques of Use Alternate Authentication Material (4)

ID Name Description
G0016 APT29 APT29 used Kerberos ticket attacks for lateral movement.
G0050 APT32 APT32 successfully gained remote access by using pass the ticket.
G0060 BRONZE
BUTLERBRONZE BUTLER has created forged Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service
(TGS) tickets to maintain administrative access.
S0002 Mimikatz Mimikatz’s LSADUMP::DCSync and KERBEROS::PTT modules implement the three steps required to extract
the krbtgt account hash and create/use Kerberos tickets.
S0192 Pupy Pupy can also perform pass-the-ticket.
S0053 SeaDuke Some SeaDuke samples have a module to use pass the ticket with Kerberos for authentication.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1015 Active Directory
ConﬁgurationTo contain the impact of a previously generated golden ticket, reset the built-in KRBTGT account
password twice, which will invalidate any existing golden tickets that have been created with the
KRBTGT hash and other Kerberos tickets derived from it. For each domain, change the KRBTGT
account password once, force replication, and then change the password a second time. Consider
rotating the KRBTGT account password every 180 days.
M1027 Password
PoliciesEnsure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementLimit domain admin account permissions to domain controllers and limited servers. Delegate other
admin functions to separate accounts.
M1018 User Account
ManagementDo not allow a user to be a local administrator for multiple systems.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active DirectoryActive Directory
Credential
RequestMonitor requests of new ticket granting ticket or service tickets to a Domain Controller.
Event ID 4769 is generated on the Domain Controller when using a golden ticket after
the KRBTGT password has been reset twice, as mentioned in the mitigation section.
The status code 0x1F indicates the action has failed due to "Integrity check on
decrypted ﬁeld failed" and indicates misuse by a previously invalidated golden ticket.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior that may "pass the ticket" using stolen
Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system
access controls.
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationAudit all Kerberos authentication and credential use events and review for
discrepancies. Unusual remote authentication events that correlate with other
suspicious activity (such as writing and executing binaries) may indicate malicious
activity.[5]
