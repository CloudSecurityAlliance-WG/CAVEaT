Remote Services: Direct Cloud VM Connections
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or
ProgramIf direct virtual machine connections are not required for administrative use, disable these
connection types where feasible.
M1018 User Account Management Limit which users are allowed to access compute infrastructure via cloud native methods.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor cloud audit logs and host logs for logon session events. These can be found in
CloudTrail, Uniﬁed Audit Logs, Windows Event Logs and /var/log/auth.log or
/var/log/secure for Linux systems.
ReferencesAdversaries may leverage Valid Accounts to log directly into accessible cloud hosted compute infrastructure through cloud native methods.
Many cloud providers offer interactive connections to virtual infrastructure that can be accessed through the Cloud API, such as Azure Serial
Console, AWS EC2 Instance Connect , and AWS System Manager..
Methods of authentication for these connections can include passwords, application access tokens, or SSH keys. These cloud native
methods may, by default, allow for privileged access on the host with SYSTEM or root level access.
Adversaries may utilize these cloud native methods to directly access virtual infrastructure and pivot through an environment. These
connections typically provide direct console access to the VM rather than the execution of scripts (i.e., Cloud Administration Command).Other sub-techniques of Remote Services (8)
