Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0094 Kimsuky Kimsuky has set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts.
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has set an Oﬃce 365 tenant level mail transport rule to send all mail in and out of the targeted
organization to the newly created account.
G0122 Silent
LibrarianSilent Librarian has set up auto forwarding rules on compromised e-mail accounts.Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the
activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further
exploits or operations. Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even
after compromised credentials are reset by administrators. Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions,
including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-
line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule.
Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.
Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received
messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by
making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or
most Exchange Administration tools.
In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual
inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-speciﬁed
conditions, then performs a user-speciﬁed action on mail that adheres to those conditions. Adversaries that abuse such features may be
able to enable forwarding on all or speciﬁc mail an organization receives.Other sub-techniques of Email Collection (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Enterprise email solutions have monitoring mechanisms that may include the ability to audit auto-
forwarding rules on a regular basis.
In an Exchange environment, Administrators can use Get-InboxRule / Remove-InboxRule and Get-
TransportRule / Remove-TransportRule to discover and remove potentially malicious auto-fowarding
and transport rules. In addition to this, a MAPI Editor can be utilized to examine the underlying
database structure and discover any modiﬁcations/tampering of the properties of auto-forwarding rules.
M1042 Disable or
Remove Feature
or ProgramConsider disabling external email forwarding.
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationUse of encryption provides an added layer of security to sensitive information sent over email. Encryption
using public key cryptography requires the adversary to obtain the private certiﬁcate along with an
encryption key to decrypt messages.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentDetection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding
rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for
the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect
that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the
normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases
with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the
existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by
using a MAPI editor to notice the modiﬁed rule property values.Auto-forwarded
messages generally contain speciﬁc detectable artifacts that may be present in the
header; such artifacts would be platform-speciﬁc. Examples include X-MS-Exchange-
Organization-AutoForwarded set to true, X-MailFwdBy and X-Forwarded-To. The
forwardingSMTPAddress parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by
administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to
the speciﬁed SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does
not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the
speciﬁed destination mailbox. High volumes of emails that bear the X-MS-Exchange-
Organization-AutoForwarded header (indicating auto-forwarding) without a
corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message
may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than
user-level.
In environments using Exchange, monitor logs for the creation or modiﬁcation of mail
transport rules.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionOn Windows systems, monitor for creation of suspicious inbox rules through the use of
the New-InboxRule , Set-InboxRule , New-TransportRule , and Set-TransportRule
PowerShell cmdlets.[3][9][10]
