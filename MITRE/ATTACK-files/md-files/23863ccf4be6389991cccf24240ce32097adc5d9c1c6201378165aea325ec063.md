Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0568 EVILNUM EVILNUM has used a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point to perform C2.
S0037 HAMMERTOSS The "tDiscoverer" variant of HAMMERTOSS establishes a C2 channel by downloading resources from Web
services like Twitter and GitHub. HAMMERTOSS binaries contain an algorithm that generates a different
Twitter handle for the malware to check for instructions every day.
G0065 Leviathan Leviathan has received C2 instructions from user proﬁles created on legitimate websites such as Github
and TechNet.
S0455 Metamorfo Metamorfo has downloaded a zip ﬁle for execution on the system.
S0052 OnionDuke OnionDuke uses Twitter as a backup C2.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce external network communication policy that prevents use of
unauthorized external services.Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without
receiving return output over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host
command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2
channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where
adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.
Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a signiﬁcant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts
within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or
Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving
adversaries an added level of protection.Other sub-techniques of Web Service (3)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
