CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used stolen cookies to access cloud resources and a
forged duo-sid cookie to bypass MFA set on an email account.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1054 Software Conﬁguration Conﬁgure browsers or tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies.Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor
authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.
Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service
so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently. Cookies are often valid for an extended period of
time, even if the web application is not actively used. After the cookie is obtained through Steal Web Session Cookie or Web Cookies, the
adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the
session cookie is active. Once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the
victim account has permissions to perform.
There have been examples of malware targeting session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication systems.Other sub-techniques of Use Alternate Authentication Material (4)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other service artifacts
that provide context of user authentication to web applications, including cloud-based
services. Combine this information with web credentials usage events to identify
authentication events that do not ﬁt the organization baseline.
DS0006 Web Credential Web Credential
UsageMonitor for anomalous access of websites and cloud-based applications by the same
user in different locations or by different systems that do not match expected
conﬁgurations.
