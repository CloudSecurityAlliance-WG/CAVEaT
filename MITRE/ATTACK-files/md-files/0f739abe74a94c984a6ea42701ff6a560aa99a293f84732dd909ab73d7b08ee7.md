Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0395 LightNeuron LightNeuron has used a malicious Microsoft Exchange transport agent for persistence.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Regularly check component software on critical services that adversaries may target for persistence
to verify the integrity of the systems and identify if unexpected changes have been made.
M1045 Code Signing Ensure all application component binaries are signed by the correct application developers.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementDo not allow administrator accounts that have permissions to add component software on these
services to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries on
unprivileged systems.Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems. Microsoft Exchange transport agents can
operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as ﬁltering spam, ﬁltering malicious
attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails. Transport agents can be written by application
developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server. Transport agents will be
invoked during a speciﬁed stage of email processing and carry out developer deﬁned tasks.
Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by
adversary-speciﬁed email events. Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange
transport pipeline, the agent can be conﬁgured to only carry out speciﬁc tasks in response to adversary deﬁned criteria. For example, the
transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exﬁltration if the recipient email
address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary.Other sub-techniques of Server Software Component (5)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems. Consider
monitoring application logs for abnormal behavior that may indicate suspicious
installation of application software components.
DS0022 File File Creation Consider monitoring ﬁle locations associated with the installation of new application
software components such as paths from which applications typically load such
extensible components.
