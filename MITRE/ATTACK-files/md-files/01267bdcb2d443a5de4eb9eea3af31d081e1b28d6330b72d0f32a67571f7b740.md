Masquerading: Break Process Trees
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls such as fork() which can be abused to masquerade or manipulate
process metadata.
Process
CreationMonitor for the abnormal creation of background processes as well as processes executing
from abnormal locations, such as /dev/shm .
ReferencesAn adversary may attempt to evade process tree-based analysis by modifying executed malware's parent process ID (PPID). If endpoint
protection software leverages the "parent-child" relationship for detection, breaking this relationship could result in the adversary’s behavior
not being associated with previous process tree activity. On Unix-based systems breaking this process tree is common practice for
administrators to execute software using scripts and programs.
On Linux systems, adversaries may execute a series of Native API calls to alter malware's process tree. For example, adversaries can execute
their payload without any arguments, call the fork() API call twice, then have the parent process exit. This creates a grandchild process
with no parent process that is immediately adopted by the init system process (PID 1), which successfully disconnects the execution of
the adversary's payload from its previous process tree.
Another example is using the "daemon" syscall to detach from the current parent process and run in the background.Other sub-techniques of Masquerading (9)
