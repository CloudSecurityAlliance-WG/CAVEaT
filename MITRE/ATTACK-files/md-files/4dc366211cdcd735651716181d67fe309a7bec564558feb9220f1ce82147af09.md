Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0601 Hildegard Hildegard has queried the Cloud Instance Metadata API for cloud credentials.
S0683 Peirates Peirates can query the query AWS and GCP metadata APIs for secrets.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has queried the AWS instance metadata service for credentials.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramDisable unnecessary metadata services and restrict or disable insecure versions of metadata services
that are in use to prevent adversary access.
M1037 Filter Network
TraﬃcLimit access to the Instance Metadata API. A properly conﬁgured Web Application Firewall (WAF) may
help prevent external adversaries from exploiting Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks that
allow access to the Cloud Instance Metadata API.
M1035 Limit Access to
Resource Over
NetworkLimit access to the Instance Metadata API using a host-based ﬁrewall such as iptables.Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.
Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows
applications to access information about the running virtual instance. Available information generally includes name, security group, and
additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets. The Instance
Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.
A cloud metadata API has been used in at least one high proﬁle compromise.
If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that
grant access to additional resources. Additionally, adversaries may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public
facing web proxy that allows them to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.
The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at http[:]//169.254.169.254 .Other sub-techniques of Unsecured Credentials (8)
