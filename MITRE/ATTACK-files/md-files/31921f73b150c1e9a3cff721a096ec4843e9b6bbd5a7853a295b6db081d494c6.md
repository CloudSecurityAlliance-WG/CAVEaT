Other sub-techniques of Scheduled Task/Job (5) 
Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for 
initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the 
Task Scheduler in Windows. The schtasks utility can be run directly on the command 
line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator 
Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET 
wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the 
Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task. 
The deprecated at utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex: At), 
though at.exe can not access tasks created with schtasks or the Control Panel. 
An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup 
or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also be 
abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a 
process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar to System 
Binary Proxy Execution , adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to 
potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.[1] 
Adversaries may also create "hidden" scheduled tasks (i.e. Hide Artifacts ) that may not 
be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically, 
an adversary may hide a task from schtasks /query and the Task Scheduler by 
deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this 
value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).[2][3] Adversaries may also employ 
alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., Index value) within 
associated registry keys.[4]

DS0022 File File Creation Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in 
%systemroot%\System32\ Tasks for change entries related to scheduled 
tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. In order 
to gain persistence, privilege escalation, or remote execution, an adv
may use the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a command to be run at 
a specified time, date, and even host. Task Scheduler stores tasks as files in 
two locations - C:\Windows\Tasks (legacy) or 
C:\Windows\System32\ Tasks. Accordingly, this analytic l

Analytic 1 - Scheduled Task - File Creation 
task\_files = filter files where ( (file\_path =

Modification Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in 
%systemroot%\System32\ Tasks for change entries related to scheduled 
tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc.
DS0029 Network Traffic Network Traffic 
Flow Monitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the 
network that do not normally have network communication or have never 
been seen before are suspicious. Look for RPC traffic after being mapped, 
which implies a destination port of at lea st 49152. If network inspection is 
available via packet captures or a NIDS, then traffic through 
the ITaskSchedulerService interface can be detected. Microsoft has a 
list of the possible methods that are implemented for 
the ITaskSchedulerService interface, which may be useful in 
differentiating read and query operations from creations and modifications.
When scheduled tasks are created remotely, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) 
to communicate with the Task Scheduler on the remote machine. Once an 
RPC connection is established, the client communicates with the 
Scheduled Tasks endpoint, which runs within the serv ice group netsvcs. 
With packet capture and the right packet decoders or byte -
signatures, remote invocations of these functions can be identified.Certain 
strings can be identifiers of the schtasks, by looking up the interface UUID 
of ITaskSchedulerService in different formats

 ASCII IYD@$621 (printable bytes only) 
This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any 
sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could 
implement this analytic.

Creation Monitor for newly constructed processes and/or command
execute from the svchost.exe in Windows 10 and the Windows Task 
Scheduler taskeng.exe for older versions of Windows. [195] If scheduled 
tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the 
task when the action is complete. Look for instances 
of schtasks.exe running as processes. The command\_line
necessary to disambiguate between types of schtasks commands. These 
include the flags /create , /run, /query, /delete , /change
and /end. 
Detection of the creation or modification of Scheduled Tasks with a 
suspicious script, extension or user writable path. Attackers may create or
