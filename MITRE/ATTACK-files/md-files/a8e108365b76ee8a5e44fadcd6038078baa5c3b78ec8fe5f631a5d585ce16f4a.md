Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the
utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating accounts (i.e. Establish Accounts), adversaries may
compromise existing accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or
knowledge of, the compromised persona.
A variety of methods exist for compromising accounts, such as gathering credentials via Phishing for Information, purchasing credentials
from third-party sites, brute forcing credentials (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps), or paying employees, suppliers or
business partners for access to credentials. Prior to compromising accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform
decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation.
Personas may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, etc.). Compromised accounts may
require additional development, this could include ﬁlling out or modifying proﬁle information, further developing social networks, or
incorporating photos.
Adversaries may directly leverage compromised email accounts for Phishing for Information or Phishing.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
DS0021 Persona Social Media Consider monitoring social media activity related to your organization. Suspicious
activity may include personas claiming to work for your organization or recently modiﬁed
accounts making numerous connection requests to accounts aﬃliated with your
organization.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target
organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be
focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex:
Phishing).
