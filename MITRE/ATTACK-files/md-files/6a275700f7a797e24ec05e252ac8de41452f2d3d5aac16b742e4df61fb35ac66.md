Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 has harvested user's login credentials.
C0027 C0027 During C0027, Scattered Spider sent phishing messages via SMS to steal credentials.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has collected credentials for the target organization from previous breaches for use in brute
force attacks.
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has gathered user identities and credentials to gain initial access to a victim's organization; the
group has also called an organization's help desk to reset a target's credentials.
G0065 Leviathan Leviathan has collected compromised credentials to use for targeting efforts.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound gathered credentials from two victims that they then attempted to validate across 75
different websites. Magic Hound has also collected credentials from over 900 Fortinet VPN servers in the
US, Europe, and Israel.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseFor the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 conducted credential theft operations to obtain credentials to be
used for access to victim environments.Adversaries may gather credentials that can be used during targeting. Account credentials gathered by adversaries may be those directly
associated with the target victim organization or attempt to take advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across
personal and business accounts.
Adversaries may gather credentials from potential victims in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information.
Adversaries may also compromise sites then add malicious content designed to collect website authentication cookies from visitors.
Credential information may also be exposed to adversaries via leaks to online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search Engines, breach
dumps, code repositories, etc.). Adversaries may also purchase credentials from dark web or other black-markets. Finally, where
multi-factor authentication (MFA) based on out-of-band communications is in use, adversaries may compromise a service provider to gain
access to MFA codes and one-time passwords (OTP).
Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Phishing for
Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Valid
Accounts).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Identity Information (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
