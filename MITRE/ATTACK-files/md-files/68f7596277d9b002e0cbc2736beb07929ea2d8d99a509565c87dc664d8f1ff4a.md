Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0377 Ebury Ebury can intercept private keys using a trojanized ssh-add function.
G1016 FIN13 FIN13 has replaced legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to collect passwords from
numerous applications.
S0487 Kessel Kessel has trojanized the ssh\_login and user-auth\_pubkey functions to steal plaintext credentials.
S0692 SILENTTRINITY SILENTTRINITY can create a backdoor in KeePass using a malicious conﬁg ﬁle and in TortoiseSVN using a
registry hook.Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to
accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the
Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins
on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may
be able to authenticate to a service or system without using Valid Accounts.
Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms. Compromised
credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be
used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.Sub-techniques (8)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Review authentication logs to ensure that mechanisms such as enforcement of MFA are functioning as
intended.
Periodically review the hybrid identity solution in use for any discrepancies. For example, review all Pass
Through Authentication (PTA) agents in the Azure Management Portal to identify any unwanted or
unapproved ones. If ADFS is in use, review DLLs and executable ﬁles in the AD FS and Global
Assembly Cache directories to ensure that they are signed by Microsoft. Note that in some cases
binaries may be catalog-signed, which may cause the ﬁle to appear unsigned when viewing ﬁle
properties.
Periodically review for new and unknown network provider DLLs within the Registry
(HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
\NetworkProvider\ProviderPath ). Ensure only valid network provider DLLs
are registered. The name of these can be found in the Registry key at
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order , and have
corresponding service subkey pointing to a DLL at HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentC
ontrolSet\Services\\NetworkProvider .
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationIntegrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk
of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as
initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to
cloud resources and APIs.
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationEnsure only valid password ﬁlters are registered. Filter DLLs must be present in Windows installation
directory (C:\Windows\System32\ by default) of a domain controller and/or local computer with a
corresponding entry in
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages .
Starting in Windows 11 22H2, the EnableMPRNotifications policy can be disabled through Group
Policy or through a conﬁguration service provider to prevent Winlogon from sending credentials to
network providers.
M1027 Password Policies Ensure that AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption property is set to disabled unless there are
application requirements.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementAudit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that
could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. 
These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are
created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an
enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers. 
Limit access to the root account and prevent users from modifying protected components through
proper privilege separation (ex SELinux, grsecurity, AppArmor, etc.) and limiting Privilege Escalation
opportunities.
Limit on-premises accounts with access to the hybrid identity solution in place. For example, limit Azure
AD Global Administrator accounts to only those required, and ensure that these are dedicated cloud-only
accounts rather than hybrid ones.
M1025 Privileged Process
IntegrityEnabled features, such as Protected Process Light (PPL), for LSA.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory
PermissionsRestrict write access to the /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins directory.
M1024 Restrict Registry
PermissionsRestrict Registry permissions to disallow the modiﬁcation of sensitive Registry keys such as
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order .[5]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active Directory Active Directory
Object
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to AD security settings related to MFA logon requirements,
such as changes to Azure AD Conditional Access Policies or the registration of new
MFA applications.
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentEnable security auditing to collect logs from hybrid identity solutions. For example,
monitor sign-ins to the Azure AD Application Proxy Connector, which are typically
generated only when a new Pass Through Authentication (PTA) Agent is added. If
AD FS is in use, review the logs for event ID 501, which speciﬁes all EKU attributes on
a claim, and raise alerts on any values that are not conﬁgured in your environment.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for suspicious additions to the /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins
directory.
Monitor for newly created ﬁles that may be used to register malicious network
provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs).
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for suspicious modiﬁcation of ﬁles associated with authentication processes,
such as conﬁguration ﬁles and module paths (e.g. /etc/pam.d/ ). Use system-
integrity tools such as AIDE and monitoring tools such as auditd to monitor PAM ﬁles.
Also monitor for access to certiﬁcates and cryptographic keys material.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across systems that share accounts,
either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple
systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine
simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or
outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process
ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a
particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a
user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have
VPN access). Conﬁgure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the
enterprise and with externally accessible services.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor for new, unfamiliar DLL ﬁles written to a domain controller and/or local
computer. Password ﬁlters will also show up as an autorun and loaded DLL in
lsass.exe. If AD FS is in use, monitor the AD FS server for the creation of DLLs as
well as the loading of unrecognized or unsigned DLLs into the
Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost application.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for calls to OpenProcess that can be used to manipulate lsass.exe running
on a domain controller as well as for malicious modiﬁcations to functions exported
from authentication-related system DLLs (such as cryptdll.dll and samsrv.dll).
Monitor for abnormal API calls to NPLogonNotify() that may highlight malicious
network provider DLLs.
Process Access Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with authentication mechanisms and
processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to
accounts.
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationMonitor for account authentications in which MFA credentials are not provided by the
user account to the authenticating entity.
User Account
ModiﬁcationMonitor for the enrollment of devices and user accounts with alternative security
settings that do not require MFA credentials for successful logon.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
CreationMonitor for the addition of network provider Registry keys (e.g.,
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
\NetworkProvider ).[5]
