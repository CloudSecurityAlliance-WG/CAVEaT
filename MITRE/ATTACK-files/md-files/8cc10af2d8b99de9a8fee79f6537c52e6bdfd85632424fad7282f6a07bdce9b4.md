Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0082 APT38 APT38 has prepended a space to all of their terminal commands to operate without leaving traces in the
HISTCONTROL environment.
S0692 SILENTTRINITY SILENTTRINITY can bypass ScriptBlock logging to execute unmanaged PowerShell code from memory.Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters
keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.
On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a ﬁle pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE . When a user logs off a system,
this information is ﬂushed to a ﬁle in the user's home directory called ~/.bash\_history . The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps
track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash\_history ﬁle when a user logs out. HISTCONTROL
does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.
Adversaries may clear the history environment variable (unset HISTFILE ) or set the command history size to zero (export
HISTFILESIZE=0 ) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally, HISTCONTROL can be conﬁgured to ignore commands that start with a
space by simply setting it to "ignorespace". HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In
some Linux systems, this is set by default to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that " ls" will not be
saved, but "ls" would be saved by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of
their terminal commands.
On Windows systems, the PSReadLine module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a ﬁle
($env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost\_history.txt by default). Adversaries may change where
these logs are saved using Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path} . This will cause ConsoleHost\_history.txt to stop
receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this ﬁle using the PowerShell command Set-PSReadlineOption -
HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing .
Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to disable historical command logging (e.g. no logging ).Other sub-techniques of Impair Defenses (11)

ID Mitigation Description
M1039 Environment Variable
PermissionsPrevent users from changing the HISTCONTROL , HISTFILE , and HISTFILESIZE environment
variables. 
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationMake sure that the HISTCONTROL environment variable is set to "ignoredups" instead of
"ignoreboth" or "ignorespace".
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionCorrelating a user session with a distinct lack of new commands in their .bash\_history
can be a clue to suspicious behavior. Monitor for modiﬁcation of PowerShell command
history settings through processes being created with -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing
command-line arguments and use of the PowerShell commands Set-PSReadlineOption
-HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing and Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath
{File Path} . For network devices, monitor for missing or inconsistencies in Network
Device CLI logging present in AAA logs as well as in speciﬁc RADIUS and TACAS+ logs.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Users checking or changing their HISTCONTROL , HISTFILE , or HISTFILESIZE environment
variables may be suspicious.
