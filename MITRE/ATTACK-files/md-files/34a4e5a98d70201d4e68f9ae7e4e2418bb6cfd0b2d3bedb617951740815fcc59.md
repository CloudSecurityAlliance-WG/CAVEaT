Conﬁguration Dump
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationConﬁgure SNMPv3 to use the highest level of security (authPriv) available.
M1037 Filter Network Traﬃc Apply extended ACLs to block unauthorized protocols outside the trusted network.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionConﬁgure intrusion prevention devices to detect SNMP queries and commands from unauthorized
sources. Create signatures to detect Smart Install (SMI) usage from sources other than trusted
director.
M1030 Network
SegmentationSegregate SNMP traﬃc on a separate management network.
M1054 Software
ConﬁgurationAllowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views. Disable Smart Install (SMI) if not used.
M1051 Update Software Keep system images and software updated and migrate to SNMPv3.Adversaries may access network conﬁguration ﬁles to collect sensitive data about the device and the network. The network conﬁguration is
a ﬁle containing parameters that determine the operation of the device. The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the conﬁguration
while operating, and a separate conﬁguration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset. Adversaries can inspect the conﬁguration
ﬁles to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and
credentials for later use.
Adversaries can use common management tools and protocols, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Smart Install
(SMI), to access network conﬁguration ﬁles. These tools may be used to query speciﬁc data from a conﬁguration repository or conﬁgure
the device to export the conﬁguration for later analysis.Other sub-techniques of Data from Conﬁguration Repository (2)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts or uncommon data ﬂows. Consider analyzing packet contents to detect
application layer protocols, leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traﬃc, that do
not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g. unauthorized,
gratuitous, or anomalous traﬃc patterns attempting to access network conﬁguration
content)
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s)
that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g. unauthorized,
gratuitous, or anomalous traﬃc patterns attempting to access network conﬁguration
content)
