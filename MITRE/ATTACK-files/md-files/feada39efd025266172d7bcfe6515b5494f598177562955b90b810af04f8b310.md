https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620/ 3/5Reﬂective Code Loading
Adversaries may reﬂectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads. Reﬂective loading involves
allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a ﬁle path on disk.
Reﬂectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous ﬁles (only present in RAM), or just snubs of ﬁleless executable code (ex:
position-independent shellcode).
Reﬂective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the "injection" loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of
that of a separate process. Reﬂective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked
within a legitimate or otherwise benign process. Reﬂectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating ﬁles or other
artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted (or otherwise obfuscated) until execution.[1][2][3][4][5]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1081 BADHATCH BADHATCH can copy a large byte array of 64-bit shellcode into process memory and execute it with a call to
CreateThread .
S1063 Brute Ratel
C4Brute Ratel C4 has used reﬂective loading to execute malicious DLLs.
S0154 Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly command can run a .NET executable within the memory of a sacriﬁcial
process by loading the CLR.
S0625 Cuba Cuba loaded the payload into memory using PowerShell.
S0695 Donut Donut can generate code modules that enable in-memory execution of VBScript, JScript, EXE, DLL, and
dotNET payloads.
S0367 Emotet Emotet has reﬂectively loaded payloads into memory.
S0661 FoggyWeb FoggyWeb's loader has reﬂectively loaded .NET-based assembly/payloads into memory.
S0666 Gelsemium Gelsemium can use custom shellcode to map embedded DLLs into memory.
S1022 IceApple IceApple can use reﬂective code loading to load .NET assemblies into MSExchangeOWAAppPool on targeted
Exchange servers.
G0032 Lazarus
GroupLazarus Group has changed memory protection permissions then overwritten in memory DLL function code
with shellcode, which was later executed via KernelCallbackTable hijacking. Lazarus Group has also used
shellcode within macros to decrypt and manually map DLLs into memory at runtime.
S0447 Lokibot Lokibot has reﬂectively loaded the decoded DLL into memory.
S1059 metaMain metaMain has reﬂectively loaded a DLL to read, decrypt, and load an orchestrator ﬁle.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit reﬂectively loads a Windows PE ﬁle into a process.
S1085 Sardonic Sardonic has a plugin system that can load specially made DLLs into memory and execute their functions.
S0595 ThiefQuest ThiefQuest uses various API functions such as NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory to load and link in-
memory payloads.
S0022 Uroburos Uroburos has the ability to load new modules directly into memory using its Load Modules Mem command.
S0689 WhisperGate WhisperGate's downloader can reverse its third stage ﬁle bytes and reﬂectively load the ﬁle as a .NET
assembly.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.[8]

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor for artifacts of abnormal process execution. For example, a common signature related
to reﬂective code loading on Windows is mechanisms related to the .NET Common Language
Runtime (CLR) -- such as mscor.dll, mscoree.dll, and clr.dll -- loading into abnormal processes
(such as notepad.exe)
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for code artifacts associated with reﬂectively loading code, such as the abuse of .NET
functions such as Assembly.Load() and Native API functions such as CreateThread() ,
memfd\_create() , execve() , and/or execveat() .
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionSimilarly, AMSI / ETW traces can be used to identify signs of arbitrary code execution from
within the memory of potentially compromised processes.
