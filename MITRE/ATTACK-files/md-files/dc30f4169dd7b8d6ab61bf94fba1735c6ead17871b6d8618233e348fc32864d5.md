Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1070 Black Basta Black Basta has set the desktop wallpaper on victims' machines to display a ransom note.
S1068 BlackCat BlackCat can change the desktop wallpaper on compromised hosts.
S0659 Diavol After encryption, Diavol will capture the desktop background window, set the background color to black, and
change the desktop wallpaper to a newly created bitmap image with the text "All your ﬁles are encrypted! For
more information see "README-FOR-DECRYPT.txt".
G0047 Gamaredon
GroupGamaredon Group has left taunting images and messages on the victims' desktops as proof of system
access.
G0032 Lazarus
GroupLazarus Group replaced the background wallpaper of systems with a threatening image after rendering the
system unbootable with a Disk Structure Wipe.
S0688 Meteor Meteor can change both the desktop wallpaper and the lock screen image to a custom image.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1053 Data
BackupConsider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that
can be used to restore organizational data. Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from
common methods adversaries may use to gain access and destroy the backups to prevent recovery.An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of
the systems. This may take the form of modiﬁcations to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop
wallpaper. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of Internal Defacement in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure
compliance with accompanying messages. Since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary's presence, it often takes place after
other intrusion goals have been accomplished.Other sub-techniques of Defacement (2)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles that may deface systems internal to an organization
in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users.
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor internal and websites for unplanned content changes.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
