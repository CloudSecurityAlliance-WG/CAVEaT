Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0108 netsh netsh can be used as a persistence proxy technique to execute a helper DLL when netsh.exe is executed.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command Execution Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence by
executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as
the loading of DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or
not normally loaded into a process.
DS0009 Process Process Creation It is likely unusual for netsh.exe to have any child processes in most
environments. Monitor process executions and investigate any child processes
spawned by netsh.exe for malicious behavior.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key
ModiﬁcationMonitor the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh registry key for any new or
suspicious entries that do not correlate with known system ﬁles or benign
software. Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as
Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network conﬁguration of a system. It contains functionality to add
helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility. The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry
at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh .
Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner. This execution would take place
anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is
present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.Other sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)
