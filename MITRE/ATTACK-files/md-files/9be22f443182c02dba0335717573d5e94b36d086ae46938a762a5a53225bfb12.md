Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1057 Data Loss
PreventionData loss prevention can detect and block sensitive data being sent over unencrypted protocols.
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for
unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the speciﬁc obfuscation technique used by a
particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions.
Adversaries will likely change tool command and control signatures over time or construct protocols in such
a way to avoid detection by common defensive tools. [141][142]
