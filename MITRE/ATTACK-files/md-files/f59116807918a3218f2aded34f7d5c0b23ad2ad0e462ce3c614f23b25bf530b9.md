Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0276 Keydnap Keydnap puts a space after a false .jpg extension so that execution actually goes through the Terminal.app
program.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Monitor for spaces at the end of ﬁle names, that can easily be checked with ﬁle monitoring.
From the user's perspective though, this is very hard to notice from within the Finder.app or on
the command-line in Terminal.app. Processes executed from binaries containing non-standard
extensions in the ﬁlename are suspicious.
ReferencesAdversaries can hide a program's true ﬁletype by changing the extension of a ﬁle. With certain ﬁle types (speciﬁcally this does not work with
.app extensions), appending a space to the end of a ﬁlename will change how the ﬁle is processed by the operating system.
For example, if there is a Mach-O executable ﬁle called evil.bin , when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and
execute. If this ﬁle is renamed to evil.txt , then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application (not
executing the binary). However, if the ﬁle is renamed to evil.txt (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user, the true
ﬁle type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed .
Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking ﬁles of any format and ultimately executing something
malicious.Other sub-techniques of Masquerading (9)
