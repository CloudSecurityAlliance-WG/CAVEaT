Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0677 AADInternals AADInternals can register a device to Azure AD.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has enrolled a device in MFA to an Azure AD environment following a successful password
guessing attack against a dormant account.
C0027 C0027 During C0027, Scattered Spider registered devices for MFA to maintain persistence through victims'
VPN.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 registered devices in order to enable mailbox syncing via
the Set-CASMailbox command.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationRequire multi-factor authentication to register devices in Azure AD. Conﬁgure multi-factor
authentication systems to disallow enrolling new devices for inactive accounts. When ﬁrst enrolling
MFA, use conditional access policies to restrict device enrollment to trusted locations or devices, and
consider using temporary access passes as an initial MFA solution to enroll a device.Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA)
system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.
MFA systems, such as Duo or Okta, allow users to associate devices with their accounts in order to complete MFA requirements. An
adversary that compromises a user’s credentials may enroll a new device in order to bypass initial MFA requirements and gain persistent
access to a network. In some cases, the MFA self-enrollment process may require only a username and password to enroll the account's
ﬁrst device or to enroll a device to an inactive account. 
Similarly, an adversary with existing access to a network may register a device to Azure AD and/or its device management system, Microsoft
Intune, in order to access sensitive data or resources while bypassing conditional access policies.
Devices registered in Azure AD may be able to conduct Internal Spearphishing campaigns via intra-organizational emails, which are less
likely to be treated as suspicious by the email client. Additionally, an adversary may be able to perform a Service Exhaustion Flood on an
Azure AD tenant by registering a large number of devices.Other sub-techniques of Account Manipulation (6)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active Directory Active Directory
Object CreationMonitor for the registration or joining of new device objects in Active Directory.
Raise alerts when new devices are registered or joined without using MFA.
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentAzure AD creates several log entries when new devices are enrolled, which can be
monitored for unexpected device registrations. Additionally, joined devices can be
viewed via the Azure AD portal.
DS0002 User Account User Account
ModiﬁcationMonitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those
originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a
suspicious login.
