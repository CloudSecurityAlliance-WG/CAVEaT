https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1124/ 3/9System Time Discovery
An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone from a local or remote system. The system time is set and stored by the
Windows Time Service within a domain to maintain time synchronization between systems and services in an enterprise network. 
System time information may be gathered in a number of ways, such as with Net on Windows by performing net time \hostname to
gather the system time on a remote system. The victim's time zone may also be inferred from the current system time or gathered by using
w32tm /tz .
On network devices, Network Device CLI commands such as show clock detail can be used to see the current time conﬁguration.
This information could be useful for performing other techniques, such as executing a ﬁle with a Scheduled Task/Job, or to discover
locality information based on time zone to assist in victim targeting (i.e. System Location Discovery). Adversaries may also use knowledge
of system time as part of a time bomb, or delaying execution until a speciﬁed date/time.[1][2]
