that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g. unauthorized,
gratuitous, or anomalous traﬃc patterns attempting to access internal and external
websites and services). Consider correlating with application monitoring for indication
of unplanned service interruptions or unauthorized content changes.
