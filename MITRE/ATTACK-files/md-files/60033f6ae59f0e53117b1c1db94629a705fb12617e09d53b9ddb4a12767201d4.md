Checks
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0012 DarkhotelDarkhotel has used malware that repeatedly checks the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the
system.
G0046 FIN7 FIN7 used images embedded into document lures that only activate the payload when a user double clicks to
avoid sandboxes.
S0439 Okrum Okrum loader only executes the payload after the left mouse button has been pressed at least three times, in
order to avoid being executed within virtualized or emulated environments.
S0543 Spark Spark has used a splash screen to check whether an user actively clicks on the screen before running malicious
code.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.Adversaries may employ various user activity checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include
changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or
sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the
implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information
learned from Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.
Adversaries may search for user activity on the host based on variables such as the speed/frequency of mouse movements and clicks ,
browser history, cache, bookmarks, or number of ﬁles in common directories such as home or the desktop. Other methods may rely on
speciﬁc user interaction with the system before the malicious code is activated, such as waiting for a document to close before activating a
macro or waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate.Other sub-techniques of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (3)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may employ various means to detect and
avoid virtualization and analysis environments. Detecting actions related to virtualization and
sandbox identiﬁcation may be diﬃcult depending on the adversary's implementation and
monitoring required.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and
analysis environments. Detecting actions related to virtualization and sandbox identiﬁcation
may be diﬃcult depending on the adversary's implementation and monitoring required.
Process
CreationUser activity-based checks will likely occur in the ﬁrst steps of an operation but may also occur
throughout as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in
isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as lateral
movement, based on the information obtained. Detecting actions related to virtualization and
sandbox identiﬁcation may be diﬃcult depending on the adversary's implementation and
monitoring required. Monitoring for suspicious processes being spawned that gather a variety
of system information or perform other forms of Discovery, especially in a short period of time,
may aid in detection.
