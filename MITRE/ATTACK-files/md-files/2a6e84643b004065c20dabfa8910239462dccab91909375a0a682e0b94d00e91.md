ID Mitigation Description
M1017 User Training Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts.Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting.
Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information.
Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect
information (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.
All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a speciﬁc individual, company, or industry. In this
scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.
 These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to
generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries may create fake social media accounts and message
employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and information about their
environment. Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned
Websites) to craft persuasive and believable lures.Other sub-techniques of Phishing for Information (4)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentMonitor social media traﬃc for suspicious activity, including messages requesting
information as well as abnormal ﬁle or data transfers (especially those involving
unknown, or otherwise suspicious accounts).Much of this activity may have a very high
occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside
the visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.Detection
efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial
Access.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
