Procedure Examples
ID Name Description

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1017 User

Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor call logs from corporate devices to identify patterns of potential voice
phishing, such as calls to/from known malicious phone numbers. Correlate these
records with system events.Adversaries may use voice communications to ultimately gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing voice is a speciﬁc variant of
spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that is employs the use of manipulating a user into providing access to
systems through a phone call or other forms of voice communications. Spearphishing frequently involves social engineering techniques,
such as posing as a trusted source (ex: Impersonation) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.
All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. In this scenario, adversaries are not directly sending malware to a victim
vice relying on User Execution for delivery and execution. For example, victims may receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a
phone number where they are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware, or install adversary-accessible remote management
tools (Remote Access Software) onto their computer.
Adversaries may also combine voice phishing with Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation in order to trick users into divulging MFA
credentials or accepting authentication prompts.Other sub-techniques of Phishing (4)
