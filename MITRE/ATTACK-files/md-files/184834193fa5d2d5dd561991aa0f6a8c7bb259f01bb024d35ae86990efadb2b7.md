Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationEnsure that all wired and/or wireless traﬃc is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for
authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure web traﬃc that may contain credentials is
protected by SSL/TLS.
M1018 User Account
ManagementIn cloud environments, ensure that users are not granted permissions to create or modify traﬃc
mirrors unless this is explicitly required.
Detection

DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
abnormal or untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor and analyze network ﬂows associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the
expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not
belong to established ﬂows, or gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns). Consider
analyzing newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted
hosts, unexpcted hardware devices, or other uncommon data ﬂows.Adversaries may leverage traﬃc mirroring in order to automate data exﬁltration over compromised infrastructure. Traﬃc mirroring is a native
feature for some devices, often used for network analysis. For example, devices may be conﬁgured to forward network traﬃc to one or more
destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device. 
Adversaries may abuse traﬃc mirroring to mirror or redirect network traﬃc through other infrastructure they control. Malicious modiﬁcations
to network devices to enable traﬃc redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit or Patch System Image.
Many cloud-based environments also support traﬃc mirroring. For example, AWS Traﬃc Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap
allow users to deﬁne speciﬁed instances to collect traﬃc from and speciﬁed targets to send collected traﬃc to.
Adversaries may use traﬃc duplication in conjunction with Network Sniﬃng, Input Capture, or Adversary-in-the-Middle depending on the
goals and objectives of the adversary.[1][2]
