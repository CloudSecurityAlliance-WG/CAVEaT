https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/002/ 3/5Establish Accounts: Email Accounts
Adversaries may create email accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use accounts created with email providers to
further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct Phishing for Information or Phishing. Adversaries may also take steps to
cultivate a persona around the email account, such as through use of Social Media Accounts, to increase the chance of success of follow-on
behaviors. Created email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: Domains).
To decrease the chance of physically tying back operations to themselves, adversaries may make use of disposable email services.Other sub-techniques of Establish Accounts (3)

Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection
efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex: Phishing).
