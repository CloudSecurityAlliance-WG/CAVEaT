https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004/ 3/5Event Triggered Execution: Unix Shell Conﬁguration
Modiﬁcation
Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. User Unix Shells execute several
conﬁguration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface
or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc ) and the user’s home
directory (~/) to conﬁgure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/proﬁle when initiated. These conﬁguration scripts run at
the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment.
When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.
Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an
example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the
/etc/profile and /etc/profile.d ﬁles. These ﬁles typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell
on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash\_profile , ~/.bash\_login , or
~/.profile which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely. Since the system only executes the
ﬁrst existing ﬁle in the listed order, adversaries have used ~/.bash\_profile to ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the
~/.bashrc ﬁle which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a
new tab in the command-line interface. Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use
the ~/.bash\_logout ﬁle to execute malicious commands at the end of a session.
For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+. When the Terminal.app is
opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell conﬁgures the system environment using
/etc/profile , /etc/zshenv , /etc/zprofile , and /etc/zlogin . The login shell then conﬁgures the user environment with
~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin . The interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to conﬁgure the user environment. Upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and
~/.zlogout are executed. For legacy programs, macOS executes /etc/bashrc on startup.Other sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)

ID Name Description
S0690 Green
LambertGreen Lambert can establish persistence on a compromised host through modifying the profile , login ,
and run command (rc) ﬁles associated with the bash , csh, and tcsh shells. 
S0362 Linux Rabbit Linux Rabbit maintains persistence on an infected machine through rc.local and .bashrc ﬁles. 
S1078 RotaJakiro When executing with non-root level permissions, RotaJakiro can install persistence by adding a command to
the .bashrc ﬁle that executes a binary in the ${HOME}/.gvfsd/.profile/ folder.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsMaking these ﬁles immutable and only changeable by certain administrators will limit the
ability for adversaries to easily create user level persistence.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence through
executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles that may establish persistence through executing
malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. For most Linux and macOS systems, a list
of ﬁle paths for valid shell options available on a system are located in the /etc/shells ﬁle.
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes to /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d , these ﬁles should only be
modiﬁed by system administrators. MacOS users can leverage Endpoint Security Framework
ﬁle events monitoring these speciﬁc ﬁles.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence through executing
malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell.[12][13]
