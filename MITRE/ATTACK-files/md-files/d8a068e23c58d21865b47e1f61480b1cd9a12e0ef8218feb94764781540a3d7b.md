https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/013/ 3/4Process Injection: Process Doppelgänging
Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
elevate privileges. Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe ﬁle operations. To ensure data integrity, TxF
enables only one transacted handle to write to a ﬁle at a given time. Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are
isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the ﬁle that existed at the time the handle was opened. To avoid
corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction. 
Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface (API) is still enabled as of Windows 10. 
Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a ﬁle-less variation of Process Injection. Similar to Process Hollowing, process doppelgänging
involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and
detection. Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection ,
VirtualProtectEx , and SetThreadContext . 
Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :
Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the ﬁle with malicious code. These changes will be
isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the ﬁle system.
Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.
This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context)
of the injecting process. However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security products since the execution is
masked under a legitimate process.Other sub-techniques of Process Injection (12)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be conﬁgured to block some types of process injection based
on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Scan ﬁle objects reported during the PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine, which triggers a
callback whenever a process is created or deleted, speciﬁcally looking for ﬁle objects with
enabled write access. Also consider comparing ﬁle objects loaded in memory to the
corresponding ﬁle on disk. 
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor and analyze calls to CreateTransaction , CreateFileTransacted ,
RollbackTransaction , and other rarely used functions indicative of TxF activity. Process
Doppelgänging also invokes an outdated and undocumented implementation of the Windows
process loader via calls to NtCreateProcessEx and NtCreateThreadEx as well as API calls
used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory .
