https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009/ 3/6Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Shortcut
Modiﬁcation
Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are
used to reference other ﬁles or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup
process.
Adversaries may abuse shortcuts in the startup folder to execute their tools and achieve persistence. Although often used as payloads in
an infection chain (e.g. Spearphishing Attachment), adversaries may also create a new shortcut as a means of indirection, while also
abusing Masquerading to make the malicious shortcut appear as a legitimate program. Adversaries can also edit the target path or entirely
replace an existing shortcut so their malware will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.
Shortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. For example, LNK browser extensions may be
modiﬁed (e.g. Browser Extensions) to persistently launch malware.Other sub-techniques of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (14)

Identifier}.lnk , which points to the malicious msdtc.exe ﬁle already created in the %CommonFiles%
directory.[2]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit permissions for who can create symbolic links in Windows to appropriate groups such as
Administrators and necessary groups for virtualization. This can be done through GPO: Computer
Conﬁguration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights
Assignment: Create symbolic links. 
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for LNK ﬁles created with a Zone Identiﬁer value greater than 1, which may indicate
that the LNK ﬁle originated from outside of the network. Analysis should attempt to relate
shortcut creation events to other potentially suspicious events based on known adversary
behavior such as process launches of unknown executables that make network connections.
File
ModiﬁcationSince a shortcut's target path likely will not change, modiﬁcations to shortcut ﬁles that do not
correlate with known software changes, patches, removal, etc., may be suspicious. Analysis
should attempt to relate shortcut ﬁle change events to other potentially suspicious events
based on known adversary behavior such as process launches of unknown executables that
make network connections.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may create or edit shortcuts to run a program
during system boot or user login.[32]
