Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0025 APT17 APT17 has created and cultivated proﬁle pages in Microsoft TechNet. To make proﬁle pages appear more
legitimate, APT17 has created biographical sections and posted in forum threads.
G0117 Fox
KittenFox Kitten has created KeyBase accounts to communicate with ransomware victims.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can create accounts that can be
used to build a persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and
appropriate aﬃliations. This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be
referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.
For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. These personas may be ﬁctitious or
impersonate real people. The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, GitHub,
Docker Hub, etc.). Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real. This could include
ﬁlling out proﬁle information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos.
Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for Phishing for
Information or Phishing.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
DS0021 Persona Social Media Consider monitoring social media activity related to your organization. Suspicious
activity may include personas claiming to work for your organization or recently
created/modiﬁed accounts making numerous connection requests to accounts aﬃliated
with your organization.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the
target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be
focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex:
Phishing).
