Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0363 Empire Empire can enumerate Security Support Providers (SSPs) as well as utilize PowerSploit's Install-SSP and
Invoke-Mimikatz to install malicious SSPs and log authentication events.
S0002 Mimikatz The Mimikatz credential dumper contains an implementation of an SSP.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit's Install-SSP Persistence module can be used to establish by installing a SSP DLL.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1025 Privileged
Process
IntegrityWindows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and later versions may make LSA run as a Protected Process
Light (PPL) by setting the Registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL ,
which requires all SSP DLLs to be signed by Microsoft. Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the
Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext
passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.
The SSP conﬁguration is stored in two Registry keys: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages and
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages . An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new
SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.Other sub-techniques of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (14)

DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse security support
providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor the LSA process for DLL loads. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2
may generate events when unsigned SSP DLLs try to load into the LSA by setting
the Registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image
