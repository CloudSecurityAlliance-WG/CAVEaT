https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/ 3/6Network Sniﬃng
Adversaries may sniff network traﬃc to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the
network. Network sniﬃng refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless
connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use
span ports to capture a larger amount of data.
Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for
name service resolution poisoning, such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay, can also be used to capture credentials to websites,
proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traﬃc to an adversary.
Network sniﬃng may also reveal conﬁguration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP
addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.
In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traﬃc mirroring services to sniff network traﬃc from virtual machines. For
example, AWS Traﬃc Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to deﬁne speciﬁed instances to collect traﬃc from and
speciﬁed targets to send collected traﬃc to. Often, much of this traﬃc will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load
balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traﬃc. The adversary can then use exﬁltration techniques such as
Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traﬃc.
On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures using Network Device CLI commands such as monitor capture .[1][2][3]

ID Name Description
C0028 2015 Ukraine
Electric Power
AttackDuring the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used BlackEnergy’s network sniffer
module to discover user credentials being sent over the network between the local LAN and the power
grid’s industrial control systems. 
G0007 APT28 APT28 deployed the open source tool Responder to conduct NetBIOS Name Service poisoning, which
captured usernames and hashed passwords that allowed access to legitimate credentials. APT28
close-access teams have used Wi-Fi pineapples to intercept Wi-Fi signals and user credentials.
G0064 APT33 APT33 has used SniffPass to collect credentials by sniﬃng network traﬃc.
G0105 DarkVishnya DarkVishnya used network sniﬃng to obtain login data. 
S0367 Emotet Emotet has been observed to hook network APIs to monitor network traﬃc. 
S0363 Empire Empire can be used to conduct packet captures on target hosts.
S0661 FoggyWeb FoggyWeb can conﬁgure custom listeners to passively monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST
requests sent to the AD FS server from the intranet/internet and intercept HTTP requests that match
the custom URI patterns deﬁned by the actor.
S0357 Impacket Impacket can be used to sniff network traﬃc via an interface or raw socket.
G0094 Kimsuky Kimsuky has used the Nirsoft SniffPass network sniffer to obtain passwords sent over non-secure
protocols.
S0443 MESSAGETAP MESSAGETAP uses the libpcap library to listen to all traﬃc and parses network protocols starting with
Ethernet and IP layers. It continues parsing protocol layers including SCTP, SCCP, and TCAP and ﬁnally
extracts SMS message data and routing metadata. 
S0590 NBTscan NBTscan can dump and print whole packet content.
S0587 Penquin Penquin can sniff network traﬃc to look for packets matching speciﬁc conditions.
S0378 PoshC2 PoshC2 contains a module for taking packet captures on compromised hosts.
S0019 Regin Regin appears to have functionality to sniff for credentials passed over HTTP, SMTP, and SMB.
S0174 Responder Responder captures hashes and credentials that are sent to the system after the name services have
been poisoned.
G0034 Sandworm Team Sandworm Team has used intercepter-NG to sniff passwords in network traﬃc.[8]

ID Mitigation Description
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationEnsure that all wired and/or wireless traﬃc is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for
authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure web traﬃc that may contain credentials is
protected by SSL/TLS.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
M1030 Network
SegmentationDeny direct access of broadcasts and multicast sniﬃng, and prevent attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-
NS Poisoning and SMB Relay
M1018 User Account
ManagementIn cloud environments, ensure that users are not granted permissions to create or modify traﬃc
mirrors unless this is explicitly required.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command

Note: The Analytic is for Windows systems and looks for new processes that have the names
of the most common network sniﬃng tools. While this may be noisy on networks where
sysadmins are using any of these tools on a regular basis, in most networks their use is
noteworthy.
