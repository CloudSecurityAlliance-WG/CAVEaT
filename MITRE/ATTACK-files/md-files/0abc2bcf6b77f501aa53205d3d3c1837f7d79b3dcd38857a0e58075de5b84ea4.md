https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/ 3/9Process Injection
Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection
is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may
allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also
evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist
for every major OS but are typically platform speciﬁc.
More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named
pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.Sub-techniques (12)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be conﬁgured to block some types of process injection based on
common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process. For example, on Windows 10,
Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules may prevent Oﬃce applications from code injection. 
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementUtilize Yama (ex: /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace\_scope) to mitigate ptrace based process injection by
restricting the use of ptrace to privileged users only. Other mitigation controls involve the deployment of
security kernel modules that provide advanced access control and process restrictions such as SELinux,
grsecurity, and AppArmor.[58]

ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Monitor for contextual data about a ﬁle, which may include information such as name, the
content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, etc.
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to ﬁles that may inject code into processes in order to evade
process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as the loading of
DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a
process.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a
signiﬁcant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under
speciﬁc circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions
may be common and diﬃcult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such
as CreateRemoteThread , SuspendThread /SetThreadContext /ResumeThread ,
QueueUserAPC /NtQueueApcThread , and those that can be used to modify memory within
another process, such as VirtualAllocEx /WriteProcessMemory , may be used for this
technique. Monitoring for Linux speciﬁc calls such as the ptrace system call should not
generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective
method to detect some of the common process injection methods. 
Process
AccessMonitor for processes being viewed that may inject code into processes in order to evade
process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Process
MetadataMonitor for process memory inconsistencies, such as checking memory ranges against a
known copy of the legitimate module.
Process
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to processes that may inject code into processes in order to evade
process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.[79]
