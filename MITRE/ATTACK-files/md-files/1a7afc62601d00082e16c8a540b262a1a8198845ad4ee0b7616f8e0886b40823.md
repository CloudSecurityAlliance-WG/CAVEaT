Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 added "junk data" to each encoded string, preventing trivial decoding without knowledge of the junk
removal algorithm. Each implant was given a "junk length" value when created, tracked by the controller
software to allow seamless communication but prevent analysis of the command protocol on the wire.
S0574 BendyBear BendyBear has used byte randomization to obscure its behavior.
S0134 Downdelph Downdelph inserts pseudo-random characters between each original character during encoding of C2 network
requests, making it diﬃcult to write signatures on them.
S0588 GoldMax GoldMax has used decoy traﬃc to surround its malicious network traﬃc to avoid detection.
S0632 GrimAgent GrimAgent can pad C2 messages with random generated values.
S1020 Kevin Kevin can generate a sequence of dummy HTTP C2 requests to obscure traﬃc.
S1047 Mori Mori has obfuscated the FML.dll with 200MB of junk data.
S0016 P2P ZeuS P2P ZeuS added junk data to outgoing UDP packets to peer implants.
S0626 P8RAT P8RAT can send randomly-generated data as part of its C2 communication.
S0435 PLEAD PLEAD samples were found to be highly obfuscated with junk code.
S0559 SUNBURST SUNBURST added junk bytes to its C2 over HTTP.
S0682 TrailBlazer TrailBlazer has used random identiﬁer strings to obscure its C2 operations and result codes.
S0647 Turian Turian can insert pseudo-random characters into its network encryption setup.
S0022 Uroburos Uroburos can add extra characters in encoded strings to help mimic DNS legitimate requests.
S0514 WellMess WellMess can use junk data in the Base64 string for additional obfuscation.Adversaries may add junk data to protocols used for command and control to make detection more diﬃcult. By adding random or
meaningless data to the protocols used for command and control, adversaries can prevent trivial methods for decoding, deciphering, or
otherwise analyzing the traﬃc. Examples may include appending/prepending data with junk characters or writing junk characters between
signiﬁcant characters.Other sub-techniques of Data Obfuscation (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate some obfuscation activity at the network level.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s),
leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traﬃc, that do not follow the expected
protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to
established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns, anomalous syntax, or
structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect
anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traﬃc
patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally initiate connections
for respective protocol(s)).
