https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/ 3/6Exﬁltration Over Web Service: Exﬁltration to Cloud
Storage
Adversaries may exﬁltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel. Cloud storage
services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.
Examples of cloud storage services include Dropbox and Google Docs. Exﬁltration to these cloud storage services can provide a signiﬁcant
amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service.Other sub-techniques of Exﬁltration Over Web Service (4)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of
unauthorized external services.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may exﬁltrate data to a cloud storage
service rather than over their primary command and control channel.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for ﬁles being accessed to exﬁltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than
over their primary command and control channel.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections to cloud services associated with
abnormal or non-browser processes.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious. Monitor for cloud storages for data exﬁltration.
Analytic 1 - Suspicious Data Exﬁl

or httpHost = "box.com" or httpHost = "drive.google.com" or httpHost =
"mega.io" or httpHost = "mediafire.com")[26]
