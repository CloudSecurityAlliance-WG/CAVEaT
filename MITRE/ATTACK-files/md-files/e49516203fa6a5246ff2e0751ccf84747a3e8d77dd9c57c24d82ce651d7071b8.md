Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0554 Egregor Egregor can modify the GPO to evade detection. 
S0363 Empire Empire can use New-GPOImmediateTask to modify a GPO that will install and execute a malicious
Scheduled Task/Job.
S0697 HermeticWiper HermeticWiper has the ability to deploy through an infected system's default domain policy.
G0119 Indrik Spider Indrik Spider has used Group Policy Objects to deploy batch scripts.
S0688 Meteor Meteor can use group policy to push a scheduled task from the AD to all network machines.
S1058 Prestige Prestige has been deployed using the Default Domain Group Policy Object from an Active Directory Domain
Controller.Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the
intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active
Directory (AD). GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of ﬁles stored within a predictable network path \\SYSVOL\
\Policies\ .
Like other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them. By default all user accounts in the domain have permission to
read GPOs. It is possible to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g. write access, to speciﬁc users or groups in the domain.
Malicious GPO modiﬁcations can be used to implement many other malicious behaviors such as Scheduled Task/Job, Disable or Modify
Tools, Ingress Tool Transfer, Create Account, Service Execution, and more. Since GPOs can control so many user and machine
settings in the AD environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this GPO abuse.
For example, publicly available scripts such as New-GPOImmediateTask can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious
Scheduled Task/Job by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying
\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml . In some cases an adversary might modify speciﬁc user
rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege, set in \MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf , to achieve a subtle
AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because the user account under the adversary's control would then be able to modify
GPOs.Other sub-techniques of Domain Policy Modiﬁcation (2)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Identify and correct GPO permissions abuse opportunities (ex: GPO modiﬁcation privileges) using
auditing tools such as BloodHound (version 1.5.1 and later).
M1018 User Account
ManagementConsider implementing WMI and security ﬁltering to further tailor which users and computers a GPO
will apply to.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active DirectoryActive Directory
Object CreationMonitor for newly constructed active directory objects, such as Windows EID 5137.
Active Directory
Object DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of an active directory object, such as Windows EID
5141.
Active Directory
Object ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to AD settings for unexpected modiﬁcations to user
accounts, such as deletions or potentially malicious changes to user attributes
(credentials, status, etc.).
DS0017 Command Command Execution Monitor executed commands and arguments that may modify Group Policy
Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain,
usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain.
