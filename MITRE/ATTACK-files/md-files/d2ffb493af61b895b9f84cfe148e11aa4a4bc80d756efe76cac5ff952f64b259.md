Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1091 Pacu Pacu can retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum\_secrets module.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementLimit the number of cloud accounts and services with permission to query the secrets manager to
only those required. Ensure that accounts and services with permissions to query the secrets manager
only have access to the secrets they require.Adversaries may acquire credentials from cloud-native secret management solutions such as AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager,
Azure Key Vault, and Terraform Vault.
Secrets managers support the secure centralized management of passwords, API keys, and other credential material. Where secrets
managers are in use, cloud services can dynamically acquire credentials via API requests rather than accessing secrets insecurely stored in
plain text ﬁles or environment variables.
If an adversary is able to gain suﬃcient privileges in a cloud environment – for example, by obtaining the credentials of high-privileged
Cloud Accounts or compromising a service that has permission to retrieve secrets – they may be able to request secrets from the secrets
manager. This can be accomplished via commands such as get-secret-value in AWS, gcloud secrets describe in GCP, and az key
vault secret show in Azure.
N o t e : this technique is distinct from Cloud Instance Metadata API in that the credentials are being directly requested from the cloud secrets
manager, rather than through the medium of the instance metadata API.Other sub-techniques of Credentials from Password Stores (6)

EnumerationMonitor for API calls and CLI commands that attempt to enumerate and fetch credential
material from the secrets manager, such as get-secret-value in AWS, gcloud
secrets describe in GCP, and az key vault secret show in Azure. Alert on any
suspicious usages of these commands, such as an account or service generating an
unusually high number of secret requests.
