Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 has collected ﬁles from network shared drives.
S0128 BADNEWS When it ﬁrst starts, BADNEWS crawls the victim's mapped drives and collects documents with the
following extensions: .doc, .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, and .txt.
G0060 BRONZE
BUTLERBRONZE BUTLER has exﬁltrated ﬁles stolen from ﬁle shares.
C0015 C0015 During C0015, the threat actors collected ﬁles from network shared drives prior to network encryption.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has collected data of interest from network shares.
S0050 CosmicDuke CosmicDuke steals user ﬁles from network shared drives with ﬁle extensions and keywords that match a
predeﬁned list.
S0554 Egregor Egregor can collect any ﬁles found in the enumerated drivers before sending it to its C2 channel.
G0117 Fox Kitten Fox Kitten has searched network shares to access sensitive documents.
G0047 Gamaredon
GroupGamaredon Group malware has collected Microsoft Oﬃce documents from mapped network drives.
G0045 menuPass menuPass has collected data from remote systems by mounting network shares with net use and using
Robocopy to transfer data.
S0458 Ramsay Ramsay can collect data from network drives and stage it for exﬁltration.
G0054 Sowbug Sowbug extracted Word documents from a ﬁle server on a victim network.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.Adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to ﬁnd ﬁles of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from
remote systems via shared network drives (host shared directory, network ﬁle server, etc.) that are accessible from the current system prior to
Exﬁltration. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within cmd may be used to gather information.

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to collect
ﬁles from a network share. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact
directly with the Windows API to gather and copy to a location. Data may also be
acquired and staged through Windows system management tools such as Windows
Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for unexpected ﬁles (i.e. .pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.) interacting with network shares.
DS0033 Network Share Network Share
AccessMonitor for unexpected and abnormal accesses to network shares.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that may search network shares on
computers they have compromised to ﬁnd ﬁles of interest. Network Analysis frameworks
such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on network protocols such as
SMB that revolve around network shares.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious. Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode,
and alert on network protocols such as SMB that revolve around network shares.
Although there may be more native ways to detect detailed SMB events on the host, they
can be extracted out of network traﬃc. With the right protocol decoders, port 445 traﬃc
can be ﬁltered and even the ﬁle path (relative to the share) can be retrieved.
Looking at this activity more closely to obtain an adequate sense of situational
awareness may make it possible to detect adversaries moving between hosts in a way
that deviates from normal activity. Because SMB traﬃc is heavy in many environments,
this analytic may be diﬃcult to turn into something that can be used to quickly detect an
APT. In some cases, it may make more sense to run this analytic in a forensic fashion.
Looking through and ﬁltering its output after an intrusion has been discovered may be
helpful in identifying the scope of compromise.
