Authentication Modules
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0377 Ebury Ebury can deactivate PAM modules to tamper with the sshd conﬁguration.
S0468 Skidmap Skidmap has the ability to replace the pam\_unix.so ﬁle on an infected machine with its own malicious version that
accepts a speciﬁc backdoor password for all users.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationIntegrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the
risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such
as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementLimit access to the root account and prevent users from modifying PAM components through proper
privilege separation (ex SELinux, grsecurity, AppArmor, etc.) and limiting Privilege Escalation
opportunities.Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to
accounts. PAM is a modular system of conﬁguration ﬁles, libraries, and executable ﬁles which guide authentication for many services. The
most common authentication module is pam\_unix.so , which retrieves, sets, and veriﬁes account authentication information in
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow .
Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors. PAM components, such as pam\_unix.so , can be patched to
accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.
Malicious modiﬁcations to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials. Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to
harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.Other sub-techniques of Modify Authentication Process (8)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationMonitor PAM conﬁguration and module paths (ex: /etc/pam.d/) for changes. Use system-
integrity tools such as AIDE and monitoring tools such as auditd to monitor PAM ﬁles.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across systems that share accounts, either
user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems
simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously;
accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business
hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from
accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.
Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login
session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).
