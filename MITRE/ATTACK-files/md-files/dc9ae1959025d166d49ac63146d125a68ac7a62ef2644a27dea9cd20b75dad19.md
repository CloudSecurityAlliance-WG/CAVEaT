https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/ 3/16Native API
Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled
means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. These native
APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and
requests during routine operations.
Adversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors. Similar to Command and Scripting Interpreter, the native
API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.
Native API functions (such as NtCreateProcess ) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often
exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries. For example, functions such as the Windows API CreateProcess() or
GNU fork() will allow programs and scripts to start other processes. This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI
command, load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.
Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs. These
frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.
Adversaries may use assembly to directly or in-directly invoke syscalls in an attempt to subvert defensive sensors and detection signatures
such as user mode API-hooks. Adversaries may also attempt to tamper with sensors and defensive tools associated with API monitoring,
such as unhooking monitored functions via Disable or Modify Tools.[1][2]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Oﬃce VBA macros from calling
Win32 APIs. 
M1038 Execution
PreventionIdentify and block potentially malicious software executed that may be executed through this technique
by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control , AppLocker, 
 or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. 
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor DLL/PE ﬁle events, speciﬁcally creation of these binary ﬁles as well as the loading of
DLLs into processes. Utilization of the Windows APIs may involve processes
loading/accessing system DLLs associated with providing called functions (ex: ntdll.dll,
kernel32.dll, advapi32.dll, user32.dll, and gdi32.dll). Monitoring for DLL loads, especially to
abnormal/unusual or potentially malicious processes, may indicate abuse of the Windows API.
Though noisy, this data can be combined with other indicators to identify adversary activity.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitoring API calls may generate a signiﬁcant amount of data and may not be useful for
defense unless collected under speciﬁc circumstances, since benign use of API functions are
common and may be diﬃcult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Correlation of other
events with behavior surrounding API function calls using API monitoring will provide
additional context to an event that may assist in determining if it is due to malicious behavior.
Correlation of activity by process lineage by process ID may be suﬃcient.[194]
