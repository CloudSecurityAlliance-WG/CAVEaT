Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramInstallUtil may not be necessary within a given environment.
M1038 Execution Prevention Use application control conﬁgured to block execution of InstallUtil.exe if it is not required for a
given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows
for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing speciﬁc installer components speciﬁed in .NET binaries. The InstallUtil binary
may also be digitally signed by Microsoft and located in the .NET directories on a Windows system:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v \InstallUtil.exe and C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v \InstallUtil.exe .
InstallUtil may also be used to bypass application control through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with
the attribute [System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)] . Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments used before and after the InstallUtil.exe
invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being
executed.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of InstallUtil.exe. Compare
recent invocations of InstallUtil.exe with prior history of known good arguments and
executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity
