https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/ 3/6Domain Trust Discovery
Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in
Windows multi-domain/forest environments. Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the
authentication procedures of another domain. Domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting
domain. The information discovered may help the adversary conduct SID-History Injection, Pass the Ticket, and Kerberoasting. Domain
trusts can be enumerated using the DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP. The Windows utility Nltest is
known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.[1]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0552 AdFind AdFind can gather information about organizational units (OUs) and domain trusts from Active Directory.
S1081 BADHATCH BADHATCH can use nltest.exe /domain\_trusts to discover domain trust relationships on a
compromised machine.
S0534 Bazar Bazar can use Nltest tools to obtain information about the domain.
S0521 BloodHound BloodHound has the ability to map domain trusts and identify misconﬁgurations for potential abuse.
S1063 Brute Ratel C4 Brute Ratel C4 can use LDAP queries and nltest /domain\_trusts for domain trust discovery.
C0015 C0015 During C0015, the threat actors used the command nltest /domain\_trusts /all\_trusts to enumerate
domain trusts.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has nltest /domain\_trusts to identify domain trust relationships.
S0105 dsquery dsquery can be used to gather information on domain trusts with dsquery \* -filter "
(objectClass=trustedDomain)" -attr \* .
G1006 Earth Lusca Earth Lusca has used Nltest to obtain information about domain controllers.
S0363 Empire Empire has modules for enumerating domain trusts.
G0061 FIN8 FIN8 has retrieved a list of trusted domains by using nltest.exe /domain\_trusts .
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has used a web shell to execute nltest /trusted\_domains to identify trust relationships.
S0359 Nltest Nltest may be used to enumerate trusted domains by using commands such as nltest
/domain\_trusts .
S0378 PoshC2 PoshC2 has modules for enumerating domain trusts.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit has modules such as Get-NetDomainTrust and Get-NetForestTrust to enumerate
domain and forest trusts.
S0650 QakBot QakBot can run nltest /domain\_trusts /all\_trusts for domain trust discovery.
S1071 Rubeus Rubeus can gather information about domain trusts.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used the Get-AcceptedDomain PowerShell cmdlet to
enumerate accepted domains through an Exchange Management Shell. They also used AdFind to
enumerate domains and to discover trust between federated domains.
S0266 TrickBot TrickBot can gather information about domain trusts by utilizing Nltest.
Mitigations

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/ 5/6Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to gather
system and network information, such as nltest /domain\_trusts. Remote access tools
with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to LDAP and
MSRPC that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g
extraneous packets that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous
traﬃc patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with gathering information on domain trust
relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement like
DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call to spot activity associated with Domain
Trust Discovery. Information may also be acquired through Windows system
management tools such as PowerShell. The .NET method GetAllTrustRelationships() can
be an indicator of Domain Trust Discovery.
Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may attempt to gather information on domain
trust relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in
Windows multi-domain/forest environments.
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running
out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts
should be captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and
intent.[3]
