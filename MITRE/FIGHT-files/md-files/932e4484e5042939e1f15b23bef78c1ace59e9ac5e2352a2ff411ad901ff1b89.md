Supply Chain Compromise:
Compromise Service Supply
Chain
Summary󰅂 󰅂
Adversaries may manipulate service or service delivery
mechanisms prior to or while used by a mobile network
operator (MNO) for the purpose of data or system
compromise.
The adversary may use the compromised service as a means
to apply additional techniques against interfaces exposed to
the service provider such as the NEF. When the service
provider hosts or provides core network functions, the
adversary may attempt to compromise the 5G core
components in the service provider environment, e.g. MEC
hosted NFs (clause 5.13 of [1]), or through the service provider
environment, attempt compromise of other core NFs not
hosted in the MEC.
When service providers are used for providing service to
customers, the adversary may be in a position to compromise
information about the subscriber.
The adversary, as an example, may also compromise
software and/or hardware used by the service provider, such
as opensource, as a technique to gain initial access or achieve
other tactics within the service provider to provide a position
for initial access to the MNO’s network. Open source software
may be an attractive target for supply chain attacks, asThis is a FiGHT
Subtechnique to an ATT&CK
Technique.
This is a theoretical behavior
in context of 5G systems.

provide a greater window of opportunity for vulnerabilities to
