Vandalism of Network
Infrastructure
Summary
Pre-Conditions󰅂 󰅂
An adversary aims to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal, or
gain unauthorized access to physical assets such as
infrastructure, hardware, or interconnection, affecting Quality
of Service (QoS) or service availability.
Actions taken by actors aimed at destroying, disabling, or
stealing physical assets supporting the 5G Network. A
physical attack to 5G critical assets may disrupt, interfere, and
ultimately cause unavailability of the network service. Despite
the existence of physical protection mechanisms (e.g.,
physical surveillance and surveillance cameras, security locks,
security guards), physical breaches and insider threat attacks
may still occur.
