Endpoint Denial of Service:
Consume data allocation to deny
or degrade service
Summary
Pre-Conditions
Post-Conditions󰅂 󰅂
A malicious app consumes subscriber data allocation to deny
or degrade service to that UE.
A malicious application might consume a UE's limited data
plan, denying or throttling service.
Name Description
A malicious app or set of apps
have to have been installed on
the UEThere are several
methods to achieve this
