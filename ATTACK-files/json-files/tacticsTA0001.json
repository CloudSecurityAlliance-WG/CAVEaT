All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon <a href=\"/techniques/T1204\">User Execution</a> to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1566/002\"> .002 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1566/002\"> Spearphishing Link </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1566/003\"> .003 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1566/003\"> Spearphishing via Service </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.

It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels. \n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1566/004\"> .004 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1566/004\"> Spearphishing Voice </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may use voice communications to ultimately gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing voice is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that is employs the use of manipulating a user into providing access to systems through a phone call or other forms of voice communications. Spearphishing frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source (ex: <a href=\"/techniques/T1656\">Impersonation</a>) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.\n\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>   \n                <tr class=\"technique\">\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1091\"> T1091 </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1091\"> Replication Through Removable Media </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                                Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.\n\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr class=\"technique\">\n                    <td colspan=\"2\">\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1195\"> T1195 </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <a href=\"/techniques/T1195\"> Supply Chain Compromise </a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                                Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.\n\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                    <tr class=\"sub technique\">\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1195/001\"> .001 </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <a href=\"/techniques/T1195/001\"> Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools </a>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                                    Adversaries may manipulate software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.
