Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be conﬁgured to block some types of process injection based
on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.
Detection

DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor library load events, especially unusual creation of these binary ﬁles followed by
loading into processes. Look for libraries that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a
process.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for malicious usage of system calls, such as ptrace and mmap, that can be used to
attach to, manipulate memory, then redirect a processes' execution path. Monitoring for Linux
speciﬁc calls such as the ptrace system call should not generate large amounts of data due to
their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common
process injection methods.Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
elevate privileges. Virtual dynamic shared object (vdso) hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate
live process.
VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries. Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to
a process via Ptrace System Calls. However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso
shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object. This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution
ﬂow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table (which store absolute addresses of
mapped library functions).
Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
elevated privileges. Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a
legitimate process.Other sub-techniques of Process Injection (12)
