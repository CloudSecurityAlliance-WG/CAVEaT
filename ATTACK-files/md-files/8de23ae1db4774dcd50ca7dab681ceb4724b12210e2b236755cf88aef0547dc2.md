Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentInternet scanners may be used to look for patterns associated with malicious content
designed to collect host hardware information from visitors. Much of this activity may
have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking
place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for
defenders. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle,
such as during Initial Access.
ReferencesAdversaries may gather information about the victim's host hardware that can be used during targeting. Information about hardware
infrastructure may include a variety of details such as types and versions on speciﬁc hosts, as well as the presence of additional
components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: card/biometric readers, dedicated encryption hardware, etc.).
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning (ex: hostnames, server
banners, user agent strings) or Phishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to
collect host information from visitors. Information about the hardware infrastructure may also be exposed to adversaries via online or
other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information
may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases),
establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex: Compromise Hardware Supply
Chain or Hardware Additions).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Host Information (4)
