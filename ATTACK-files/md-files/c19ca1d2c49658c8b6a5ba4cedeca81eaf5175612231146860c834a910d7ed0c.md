https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/ 3/6Protocol Tunneling
Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network ﬁltering
and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another. This
behavior may conceal malicious traﬃc by blending in with existing traﬃc and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN).
Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or
other traﬃc that would be ﬁltered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet.
There are various means to encapsulate a protocol within another protocol. For example, adversaries may perform SSH tunneling (also
known as SSH port forwarding), which involves forwarding arbitrary data over an encrypted SSH tunnel.
Protocol Tunneling may also be abused by adversaries during Dynamic Resolution. Known as DNS over HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2
infrastructure may be encapsulated within encrypted HTTPS packets.
Adversaries may also leverage Protocol Tunneling in conjunction with Proxy and/or Protocol Impersonation to further conceal C2
communications and infrastructure.[1]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1063 Brute Ratel C4 Brute Ratel C4 can use DNS over HTTPS for C2.
C0027 C0027 During C0027, Scattered Spider used SSH tunneling in targeted environments.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has encapsulated Cobalt Strike's C2 protocol in DNS and HTTPS.
G0080 Cobalt Group Cobalt Group has used the Plink utility to create SSH tunnels.
S0154 Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike uses a custom command and control protocol that is encapsulated in HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS. In
addition, it conducts peer-to-peer communication over Windows named pipes encapsulated in the SMB
protocol. All protocols use their standard assigned ports.
C0004 CostaRicto During CostaRicto, the threat actors set up remote SSH tunneling into the victim's environment from a
malicious domain.
S0687 Cyclops Blink Cyclops Blink can use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to resolve C2 nodes.
S0038 Duqu Duqu uses a custom command and control protocol that communicates over commonly used ports, and is
frequently encapsulated by application layer protocols.
G1016 FIN13 FIN13 has utilized web shells and Java tools for tunneling capabilities to and from compromised assets.
G0037 FIN6 FIN6 used the Plink command-line utility to create SSH tunnels to C2 servers.
S0173 FLIPSIDE FLIPSIDE uses RDP to tunnel traﬃc from a victim environment.
G0117 Fox Kitten Fox Kitten has used protocol tunneling for communication and RDP activity on compromised hosts through
the use of open source tools such as ngrok and custom tool SSHMinion.
S1044 FunnyDream FunnyDream can connect to HTTP proxies via TCP to create a tunnel to C2.
S1027 Heyoka
BackdoorHeyoka Backdoor can use spoofed DNS requests to create a bidirectional tunnel between a compromised
host and its C2 servers.
S0604 Industroyer Industroyer attempts to perform an HTTP CONNECT via an internal proxy to establish a tunnel.
S1020 Kevin Kevin can use a custom protocol tunneled through DNS or HTTP.
G0065 Leviathan Leviathan has used protocol tunneling to further conceal C2 communications and infrastructure.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has used Plink to tunnel RDP over SSH.
S1015 Milan Milan can use a custom protocol tunneled through DNS or HTTP.
S0699 Mythic Mythic can use SOCKS proxies to tunnel traﬃc through another protocol.
S0508 ngrok ngrok can tunnel RDP and other services securely over internet connections.
G0049 OilRig OilRig has used the Plink utility and other tools to create tunnels to C2 servers.
S0650 QakBot The QakBot proxy module can encapsulate SOCKS5 protocol within its own proxy protocol.
S0022 Uroburos Uroburos has the ability to communicate over custom communications methodologies that ride over
common network protocols including raw TCP and UDP sockets, HTTP, SMTP, and DNS.[3][4]

CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
