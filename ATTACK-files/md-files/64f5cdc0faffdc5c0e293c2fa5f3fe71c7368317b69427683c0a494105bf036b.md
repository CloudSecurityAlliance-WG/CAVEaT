Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0381 FlawedAmmyy FlawedAmmyy may obfuscate portions of the initial C2 handshake.
S1044 FunnyDream FunnyDream can send compressed and obfuscated packets to C2.
C0014 Operation Wocao During Operation Wocao, threat actors encrypted IP addresses used for "Agent" proxy hops with RC4.
S0495 RDAT RDAT has used encoded data within subdomains as AES ciphertext to communicate from the host to the
C2.
S0610 SideTwist SideTwist can embed C2 responses in the source code of a fake Flickr webpage.
S0533 SLOTHFULMEDIA SLOTHFULMEDIA has hashed a string containing system information prior to exﬁltration via POST
requests.
S0682 TrailBlazer TrailBlazer can masquerade its C2 traﬃc as legitimate Google Notiﬁcations HTTP requests.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate some obfuscation activity at the network level.Adversaries may obfuscate command and control traﬃc to make it more diﬃcult to detect. Command and control (C2) communications are
hidden (but not necessarily encrypted) in an attempt to make the content more diﬃcult to discover or decipher and to make the
communication less conspicuous and hide commands from being seen. This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to
protocol traﬃc, using steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols.Sub-techniques (3)

DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s),
leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traﬃc, that do not follow the expected
protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to
established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns, anomalous syntax, or
structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect
anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traﬃc
patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally initiate connections
for respective protocol(s)).
