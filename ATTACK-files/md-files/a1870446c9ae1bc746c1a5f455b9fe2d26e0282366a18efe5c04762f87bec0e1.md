Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and
remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by
restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.
Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance. Most cloud providers provide various
types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.Other sub-techniques of Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure (5)

Instance
ModiﬁcationEstablish centralized logging of instance activity, which can be used to monitor and review
system events even after reverting to a snapshot, rolling back changes, or changing
persistence/type of storage. Monitor speciﬁcally for events related to snapshots and rollbacks
and VM conﬁguration changes, that are occurring outside of normal activity. To reduce false
positives, valid change management procedures could introduce a known identiﬁer that is
logged with the change (e.g., tag or header) if supported by the cloud provider, to help
distinguish valid, expected actions from malicious ones.
Instance Start Establish centralized logging of instance activity, which can be used to monitor and review
system events even after reverting to a snapshot, rolling back changes, or changing
persistence/type of storage. Monitor speciﬁcally for events related to activation of instances
that are occurring outside of normal activity/planned operations. To reduce false positives,
valid change management procedures could introduce a known identiﬁer that is logged with
the change (e.g., tag or header) if supported by the cloud provider, to help distinguish valid,
expected actions from malicious ones.
Instance Stop Establish centralized logging of instance activity, which can be used to monitor and review
system events even after reverting to a snapshot, rolling back changes, or changing
persistence/type of storage. Monitor speciﬁcally for events related to deactivation of instances
that are occurring outside of planned operations. To reduce false positives, valid change
management procedures could introduce a known identiﬁer that is logged with the change
(e.g., tag or header) if supported by the cloud provider, to help distinguish valid, expected
actions from malicious ones.
