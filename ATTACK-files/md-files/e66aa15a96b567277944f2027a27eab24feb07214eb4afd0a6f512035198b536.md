https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/001/ 3/6File and Directory Permissions Modiﬁcation: Windows
File and Directory Permissions Modiﬁcation
Adversaries may modify ﬁle or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected ﬁles. File and
directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs conﬁgured by the ﬁle or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions.
File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions
(read, write, execute, etc.).
Windows implements ﬁle and directory ACLs as Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs). Similar to a standard ACL, DACLs identiﬁes
the accounts that are allowed or denied access to a securable object. When an attempt is made to access a securable object, the system
checks the access control entries in the DACL in order. If a matching entry is found, access to the object is granted. Otherwise, access is
denied.
Adversaries can interact with the DACLs using built-in Windows commands, such as icacls , cacls , takeown , and attrib , which can
grant adversaries higher permissions on speciﬁc ﬁles and folders. Further, PowerShell provides cmdlets that can be used to retrieve or
modify ﬁle and directory DACLs. Speciﬁc ﬁle and directory modiﬁcations may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing
Persistence via Accessibility Features, Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/conﬁguration ﬁles
via Hijack Execution Flow.Other sub-techniques of File and Directory Permissions Modiﬁcation (2)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/001/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0570 BitPaymer BitPaymer can use icacls /reset and takeown /F to reset a targeted executable's permissions and then
take ownership.
S1068 BlackCat BlackCat can use Windows commands such as fsutil behavior set SymLinkEvaluation R2L:1 to
redirect ﬁle system access to a different location after gaining access into compromised networks.
S0693 CaddyWiper CaddyWiper can modify ACL entries to take ownership of ﬁles.
S0531 Grandoreiro Grandoreiro can modify the binary ACL to prevent security tools from running.
S0201 JPIN JPIN can use the command-line utility cacls.exe to change ﬁle permissions.
S0446 Ryuk Ryuk can launch icacls /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q to delete every access-based restrictions on ﬁles
and directories.
S0366 WannaCry WannaCry uses attrib +h and icacls . /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q to make some of its ﬁles hidden
and grant all users full access controls.
S0612 WastedLocker WastedLocker has a command to take ownership of a ﬁle and reset the ACL permissions using the
takeown.exe /F filepath command.
G0102 Wizard Spider Wizard Spider has used the icacls command to modify access control to backup servers, providing them
with full control of all the system folders.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementEnsure critical system ﬁles as well as those known to be abused by adversaries have restrictive
permissions and are owned by an appropriately privileged account, especially if access is not
required by users nor will inhibit system functionality.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory PermissionsApplying more restrictive permissions to ﬁles and directories could prevent adversaries from
modifying the access control lists.[5]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0026 Active DirectoryActive Directory
Object
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to DACLs and ﬁle/directory ownership. Many of the
commands used to modify DACLs and ﬁle/directory ownership are built-in system
utilities and may generate a high false positive alert rate, so compare against baseline
knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modiﬁcation events with
other indications of malicious activity where possible.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor for executed commands and arguments for PowerShell cmdlets that can be
used to retrieve or modify ﬁle and directory DACLs.
DS0022 File File Metadata Consider enabling ﬁle/directory permission change auditing on folders containing key
binary/conﬁguration ﬁles. For example, Windows Security Log events (Event ID 4670)
are created when DACLs are modiﬁed.
Adversaries sometimes modify object access rights at the operating system level.
There are varying motivations behind this action - they may not want some
ﬁles/objects to be changed on systems for persistence reasons and therefore provide
admin only rights; also, they may want ﬁles to be accessible with lower levels of
permissions.
Windows environment logs can be noisy, so we take the following into consideration:
We need to exclude events generated by the local system (subject security ID "NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM") and focus on actual user events.
When a permission modiﬁcation is made for a folder, a new event log is
generated for each subfolder and ﬁle under that folder. It is advised to group logs
based on handle ID or user ID.
The Windows security log (event ID 4670) also includes information about the
process that modiﬁes the ﬁle permissions. It is advised to focus on uncommon
process names, and it is also uncommon for real-users to perform this task
without a GUI.
Pseudocode Event ID is for Windows Security Log (Event ID 4670 - Permissions
on an object were changed).
Windows Event ID 4719 (An Attempt Was Made to Access An Object) can also be
used to alert on changes to Active Directory audit policy for a system.
Linux environment logs can be more noisy than the Windows-speciﬁc implementation,
although Linux does not generate logs for system triggered activities like in Windows.
In addition, it may be necessary to whitelist cron jobs that regularly run and execute
chmod.
