Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 uses a tool that captures information from air-gapped computers via an infected USB and transfers it
to network-connected computer when the USB is inserted.
S0023 CHOPSTICK Part of APT28's operation involved using CHOPSTICK modules to copy itself to air-gapped machines, using
ﬁles written to USB sticks to transfer data and command traﬃc.
S0136 USBStealer USBStealer drops commands for a second victim onto a removable media drive inserted into the ﬁrst victim,
and commands are executed when the drive is inserted into the second victim.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature or
ProgramDisable Autoruns if it is unnecessary.
M1028 Operating System
ConﬁgurationDisallow or restrict removable media at an organizational policy level if they are not
required for business operations.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0016 Drive Drive Access Monitor for unexpected ﬁle access on removable media
Drive Creation Monitor for newly executed processes when removable media is mounted.Adversaries can perform command and control between compromised hosts on potentially disconnected networks using removable media
to transfer commands from system to system. Both systems would need to be compromised, with the likelihood that an Internet-connected
system was compromised ﬁrst and the second through lateral movement by Replication Through Removable Media. Commands and ﬁles
would be relayed from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system to which the adversary has direct access.
