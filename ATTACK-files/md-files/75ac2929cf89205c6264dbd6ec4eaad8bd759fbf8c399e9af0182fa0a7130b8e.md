https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/ 3/16Data from Local System
Adversaries may search local system sources, such as ﬁle systems and conﬁguration ﬁles or local databases, to ﬁnd ﬁles of interest and
sensitive data prior to Exﬁltration.
Adversaries may do this using a Command and Scripting Interpreter, such as cmd as well as a Network Device CLI, which have functionality
to interact with the ﬁle system to gather information. Adversaries may also use Automated Collection on the local system.[1]

M1057 Data Loss
PreventionData loss prevention can restrict access to sensitive data and detect sensitive data that is
unencrypted.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may search and collect local system
sources, such as ﬁle systems or local databases, to ﬁnd ﬁles of interest and sensitive data
prior to Exﬁltration. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the
Windows API to gather data. Data may also be acquired through Windows system
management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.
For network devices, monitor executed commands in AAA logs, especially those run by
unexpected or unauthorized users.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for unexpected/abnormal access to ﬁles that may be malicious collection of local
data, such as user ﬁles (pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.) or local databases.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may search local system sources, such as ﬁle systems or local
databases, to ﬁnd ﬁles of interest and sensitive data prior to Exﬁltration.
Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may search local system sources, such as ﬁle
systems or local databases, to ﬁnd ﬁles of interest and sensitive data prior to Exﬁltration.
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of
cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be
captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and intent. Data may
also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management
Instrumentation and PowerShell.3/22/24, 3:50 PM Data from Local System, Technique T1005 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
