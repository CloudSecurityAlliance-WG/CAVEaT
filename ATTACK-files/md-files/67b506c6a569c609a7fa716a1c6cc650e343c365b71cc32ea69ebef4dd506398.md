Acquire Infrastructure: DNS Server
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0001 Axiom Axiom has acquired dynamic DNS services for use in the targeting of intended victims.
G1001 HEXANE HEXANE has set up custom DNS servers to send commands to compromised hosts via TXT records.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
Detection
Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection
efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.
ReferencesAdversaries may set up their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity,
adversaries may utilize DNS traﬃc for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: Application Layer Protocol). Instead of
hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to conﬁgure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.
By running their own DNS servers, adversaries can have more control over how they administer server-side DNS C2 traﬃc (DNS). With control
over a DNS server, adversaries can conﬁgure DNS applications to provide conditional responses to malware and, generally, have more
ﬂexibility in the structure of the DNS-based C2 channel.Other sub-techniques of Acquire Infrastructure (8)
