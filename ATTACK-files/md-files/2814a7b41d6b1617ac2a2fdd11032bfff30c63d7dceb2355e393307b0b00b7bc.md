https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/ 3/16Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment
Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing
attachment is a speciﬁc variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it
employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a
speciﬁc individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a ﬁle to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User
Execution to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.
There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Oﬃce documents, executables, PDFs, or archived ﬁles. Upon opening the
attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's
system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the ﬁle should be opened, and may explain how to
bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip ﬁle
password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate ﬁle extensions and icons in order to make attached
executables appear to be document ﬁles, or ﬁles exploiting one application appear to be a ﬁle for a different one.Other sub-techniques of Phishing (4)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Anti-virus can also automatically quarantine suspicious ﬁles.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious email
attachments can be used to block activity.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentBlock unknown or unused attachments by default that should not be transmitted over email as a
best practice to prevent some vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc. Some email scanning
devices can open and analyze compressed and encrypted formats, such as zip and rar that may
be used to conceal malicious attachments.
M1054 Software Conﬁguration Use anti-spooﬁng and email authentication mechanisms to ﬁlter messages based on validity
checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these
mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients
(intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message ﬁltering and validation.
M1017 User Training Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails.[238]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to
victim systems. Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when
the email sender is spoofed. Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious
documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on
the user's computer. Monitor for suspicious descendant process spawning from
Microsoft Oﬃce and other productivity software.
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles from a spearphishing emails with a malicious
attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze SSL/TLS traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to
protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g
extraneous packets that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous
traﬃc patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process
monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command
line arguments associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that
do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)). Filtering based on
DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.[251][252]
