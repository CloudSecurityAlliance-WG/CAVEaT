Weakness
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0089 BlackEnergy One variant of BlackEnergy locates existing driver services that have been disabled and drops its driver
component into one of those service's paths, replacing the legitimate executable. The malware then sets the
hijacked service to start automatically to establish persistence.Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use ﬂaws in the
permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically
execute speciﬁc binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the ﬁle system directory containing a
target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-
level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then
the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.
Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions
level. If the executing process is set to run at a speciﬁc time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be
used for persistence.Other sub-techniques of Hijack Execution Flow (12)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Use auditing tools capable of detecting ﬁle system permissions abuse opportunities on systems within an
enterprise and correct them. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be
used to explore systems for service ﬁle system permissions weaknesses.
M1052 User Account
ControlTurn off UAC's privilege elevation for standard users
[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System] to
automatically deny elevation requests, add: "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser"=dword:00000000 . Consider
enabling installer detection for all users by adding: "EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000001 . This
will prompt for a password for installation and also log the attempt. To disable installer detection, instead
add: "EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000000 . This may prevent potential elevation of privileges
through exploitation during the process of UAC detecting the installer, but will allow the installation process
to continue without being logged.
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with
service changes and service binary target path locations. Deny execution from user directories such as ﬁle
download directories and temp directories where able.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for creation of binaries and service executables that do not occur during a regular
software update or an update scheduled by the organization. This behavior also considers
ﬁles that are overwritten.
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for modiﬁcation of binaries and service executables that do not occur during a regular
software update or an update scheduled by the organization. Modiﬁcation of ﬁles considers
actions such as renaming and directory moving.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may execute their own malicious payloads by
hijacking the binaries used by services.
DS0019 Service Service
MetadataHashing of binaries and service executables could be used to detect replacement against
historical data.
