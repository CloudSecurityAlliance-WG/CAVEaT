https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/ 3/17User Execution: Malicious File
An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious ﬁle in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get
them to open a ﬁle that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing
Attachment. Adversaries may use several types of ﬁles that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif,
and .cpl.
Adversaries may employ various forms of Masquerading and Obfuscated Files or Information to increase the likelihood that a user will open
and successfully execute a malicious ﬁle. These methods may include using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the
ﬁle and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it.
While Malicious File frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary
places a ﬁle in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after Internal
Spearphishing.Other sub-techniques of User Execution (3)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, various Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules can be enabled to prevent the execution of
potentially malicious executable ﬁles (such as those that have been downloaded and executed by Oﬃce
applications/scripting interpreters/email clients or that do not meet speciﬁc prevalence, age, or trusted list
criteria). Note: cloud-delivered protection must be enabled for certain rules. 
M1038 Execution
PreventionApplication control may be able to prevent the running of executables masquerading as other ﬁles.
M1017 User Training Use user training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and
how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles that are downloaded and executed on the user's computer.
Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the ﬁle is
opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning
powershell.exe).
While batch ﬁles are not inherently malicious, it is uncommon to see them created after OS
installation, especially in the Windows directory. This analytic looks for the suspicious activity
of a batch ﬁle being created within the C:\Windows\System32 directory tree. There will be only
occasional false positives due to administrator actions.
For Windows, Sysmon Event ID 11 (File create) can be used to track ﬁle creation events. This
event also provides the Process ID of the process that created the ﬁle, which can be correlated
with process creation events (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1) to determine if the ﬁle was downloaded
from an external network.
For MacOS, utilities that work in concert with Apple’s Endpoint Security Framework such as File
Monitor can be used to track ﬁle creation events.
Analytic 1 : Batch File Write to System32
batch\_files = filter files where ( extension =".bat" AND file\_path =
"C:\Windows\system32\*" )
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines for applications that may be
used by an adversary to gain initial access that require user interaction. This includes
compression applications, such as those for zip ﬁles, that can be used to Deobfuscate/Decode
Files or Information in payloads.[261]
