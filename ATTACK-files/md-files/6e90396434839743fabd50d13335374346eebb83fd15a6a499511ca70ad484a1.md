Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security
Appliances
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
ReferencesAdversaries may gather information about the victim's network security appliances that can be used during targeting. Information about
network security appliances may include a variety of details, such as the existence and speciﬁcs of deployed ﬁrewalls, content ﬁlters, and
proxies/bastion hosts. Adversaries may also target information about victim network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) or other
appliances related to defensive cybersecurity operations.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning or Phishing for Information.
Information about network security appliances may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search
Victim-Owned Websites). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Technical
Databases or Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or
initial access (ex: External Remote Services).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Network Information (6)
