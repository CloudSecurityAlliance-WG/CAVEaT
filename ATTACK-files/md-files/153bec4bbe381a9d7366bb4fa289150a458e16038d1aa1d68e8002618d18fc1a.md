https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/011/ 3/6Obfuscated Files or Information: Fileless Storage
Adversaries may store data in "ﬁleless" formats to conceal malicious activity from defenses. Fileless storage can be broadly deﬁned as any
format other than a ﬁle. Common examples of non-volatile ﬁleless storage include the Windows Registry, event logs, or WMI repository.
Similar to ﬁleless in-memory behaviors such as Reﬂective Code Loading and Process Injection, ﬁleless data storage may remain undetected
by anti-virus and other endpoint security tools that can only access speciﬁc ﬁle formats from disk storage.
Adversaries may use ﬁleless storage to conceal various types of stored data, including payloads/shellcode (potentially being used as part of
Persistence) and collected data not yet exﬁltrated from the victim (e.g., Local Data Staging). Adversaries also often encrypt, encode, splice,
or otherwise obfuscate this ﬁleless data when stored.
Some forms of ﬁleless storage activity may indirectly create artifacts in the ﬁle system, but in central and otherwise diﬃcult to inspect
formats such as the WMI (e.g., %SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem\Repository ) or Registry (e.g., %SystemRoot%\System32\Config ) physical
ﬁles.Other sub-techniques of Obfuscated Files or Information (12)
