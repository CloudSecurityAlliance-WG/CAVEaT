Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementEnsure containers are not running as root by default. In Kubernetes environments, consider deﬁning
Pod Security Standards that prevent pods from running privileged containers.
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit privileges of user accounts and remediate privilege escalation vectors so only authorized
administrators can create container orchestration jobs.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0032 Container Container
CreationMonitor for newly constructed containers
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles by using the logging agents on Kubernetes nodes
and retrieve logs from sidecar proxies for application and resource pods to monitor
malicious container orchestration job deployments.
DS0003 Scheduled Job Scheduled Job
CreationMonitor for the anomalous creation of scheduled jobs in container orchestration
environments.Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment
of containers conﬁgured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a speciﬁc date and time,
similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be conﬁgured to maintain a quantity of containers over time,
automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.
In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform speciﬁc tasks. An adversary
therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.Other sub-techniques of Scheduled Task/Job (5)
