https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003/ 3/8Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion
Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include
enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual
machine environment (VME) or sandbox, speciﬁcally those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time.
Adversaries may employ various time-based evasions, such as delaying malware functionality upon initial execution using programmatic
sleep commands or native system scheduling functionality (ex: Scheduled Task/Job). Delays may also be based on waiting for speciﬁc
victim conditions to be met (ex: system time, events, etc.) or employ scheduled Multi-Stage Channels to avoid analysis and scrutiny.
Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution. Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands,
such as Pings, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments.
Another variation, commonly referred to as API hammering, involves making various calls to Native API functions in order to delay execution
(while also potentially overloading analysis environments with junk data).
Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate
time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time. For example, an adversary may be able to identify a sandbox accelerating time by
sampling and calculating the expected value for an environment's timestamp before and after execution of a sleep function.Other sub-techniques of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (3)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may employ various time-based methods to
detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. Detecting actions related to
virtualization and sandbox identiﬁcation may be diﬃcult depending on the adversary's
implementation and monitoring required.

ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid
virtualization and analysis environments. Detecting actions related to virtualization and
sandbox identiﬁcation may be diﬃcult depending on the adversary's implementation and
monitoring required.
Process
CreationTime-based evasion will likely occur in the ﬁrst steps of an operation but may also occur
throughout as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in
isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as lateral
movement, based on the information obtained. Detecting actions related to virtualization and
sandbox identiﬁcation may be diﬃcult depending on the adversary's implementation and
monitoring required. Monitoring for suspicious processes being spawned that gather a variety
of system information or perform other forms of Discovery, especially in a short period of time,
may aid in detection.3/22/24, 3:46 PM Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion, Sub-technique T1497.003 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
