Translation Traversal
Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation (NAT) conﬁguration. Malicious
modiﬁcations to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traﬃc routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted
networks.
Network devices such as routers and ﬁrewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing
packets between networks. When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address
header. Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device. A typical example of this is environments where
internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.
When an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT conﬁgurations to send traﬃc between
two separated networks, or they can implement NAT conﬁgurations of their own design. In the case of network designs that require NAT to
function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected
systems behind the border device. In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to
obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data
transmissions more challenging for defenders.
Adversaries may use Patch System Image to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT
mechanisms to further obscure their activities[1]

ID Mitigation Description
M1043 Credential Access
ProtectionSome embedded network devices are capable of storing passwords for local accounts in either plain-
text or encrypted formats. Ensure that, where available, local passwords are always encrypted, per
vendor recommendations. 
M1037 Filter Network
TraﬃcBlock Traﬃc Upon identifying a compromised network device being used to bridge a network boundary,
block the malicious packets using an unaffected network device in path, such as a ﬁrewall or a router
that has not been compromised. Continue to monitor for additional activity and to ensure that the
blocks are indeed effective.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices
support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS. Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access
control. 
M1027 Password Policies Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies. 
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementRestrict administrator accounts to as few individuals as possible, following least privilege principles.
Prevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts, particularly
between network and non-network platforms, such as servers or endpoints.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
