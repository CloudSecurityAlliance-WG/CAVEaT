https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004/ 3/9Masquerading: Masquerade Task or Service
Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the name of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign. Tasks/services executed by the
Task Scheduler or systemd will typically be given a name and/or description. Windows services will have a service name as well as a
display name. Many benign tasks and services exist that have commonly associated names. Adversaries may give tasks or services names
that are similar or identical to those of legitimate ones.
Tasks or services contain other ﬁelds, such as a description, that adversaries may attempt to make appear legitimate.Other sub-techniques of Masquerading (9)

Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to manipulate the name
of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign.
DS0003 Scheduled Job Scheduled Job
MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a scheduled job, which may include information
such as name, timing, command(s), etc.
Scheduled Job
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to scheduled jobs for unexpected modiﬁcations to execution
launch
DS0019 Service Service Creation Monitor for newly constructed services/daemons. Data and events should not be
viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities,
such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about
the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.
