https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/ 3/20System Network Conﬁguration Discovery
Adversaries may look for details about the network conﬁguration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of systems they access or
through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this
information. Examples include Arp, ipconﬁg/ifconﬁg, nbtstat, and route.
Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather information about conﬁgurations and settings, such as IP
addresses of conﬁgured interfaces and static/dynamic routes (e.g. show ip route , show ip interface ).
Adversaries may use the information from System Network Conﬁguration Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on
behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do next.Sub-techniques (2)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/ 14/20Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may look for details about the network
conﬁguration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of systems they access or
through information discovery of remote systems. For network devices, monitor executed
commands in AAA logs, especially those run by unexpected or unauthorized users.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls (such as GetAdaptersInfo() and GetIpNetTable() ) that may gather
details about the network conﬁguration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses.
Process
CreationMonitor for executed processes (such as ipconﬁg/ifconﬁg and arp) with arguments that may
look for details about the network conﬁguration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC
addresses.
Note: The Analytic looks for the creation of ipconﬁg, route, and nbtstat processes, all of which
are system administration utilities that can be used for the purpose of system network
conﬁguration discovery. If these tools are commonly used in your environment (e.g., by
system administrators) this may lead to false positives and this analytic will therefore require
tuning.
Analytic 1 - Suspicious Process
processes = filter processes where ( (event\_id == "1" OR event\_id == "4688")
AND exe == "C:\Windows\System32\ipconfig.exe" OR exe ==
"C:\Windows\System32\route.exe" OR exe == "C:\Windows\System32\nbtstat.exe")
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of
cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be
captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and intent.3/22/24, 3:49 PM System Network Conﬁguration Discovery, Technique T1016 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
