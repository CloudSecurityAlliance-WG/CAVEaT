G0059 Magic
HoundMagic Hound has disabled LSA protection on compromised hosts using "reg" add
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA /v RunAsPPL /t REG\_DWORD /d 0 /f .
S0603 Stuxnet Stuxnet reduces the integrity level of objects to allow write actions.Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only
involves impairing preventative defenses, such as ﬁrewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit
activity and identify malicious behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users
and administrators.
Adversaries may also impair routine operations that contribute to defensive hygiene, such as blocking users from logging out of a computer
or stopping it from being shut down. These restrictions can further enable malicious operations as well as the continued propagation of
incidents.
Adversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system
components.Sub-techniques (11)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/ 4/6Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Routinely check account role permissions to ensure only expected users and roles have permission to
modify defensive tools and settings.
M1038 Execution
PreventionUse application control where appropriate, especially regarding the execution of tools outside of the
organization's security policies (such as rootkit removal tools) that have been abused to impair
system defenses. Ensure that only approved security applications are used and running on enterprise
systems.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory
PermissionsEnsure proper process and ﬁle permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or
interfering with security/logging services.
M1024 Restrict Registry
PermissionsEnsure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering
with security/logging services.
M1054 Software
ConﬁgurationConsider implementing policies on internal web servers, such HTTP Strict Transport Security, that
enforce the use of HTTPS/network traﬃc encryption to prevent insecure connections.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnsure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with
security/logging services.[4]3/22/24, 3:42 PM Impair Defenses, Technique T1562 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0025 Cloud Service Cloud Service
DisableMonitor logs for API calls to disable logging. In AWS, monitor for: StopLogging
and DeleteTrail . In GCP, monitor for:
google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.UpdateSink . In Azure, monitor for az
monitor diagnostic-settings delete . Additionally, a sudden loss of a log
source may indicate that it has been disabled.
Cloud Service
ModiﬁcationMonitor changes made to cloud services for unexpected modiﬁcations to settings
and/or data.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may maliciously modify
components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive
mechanisms.
DS0027 Driver Driver Load Monitor for unusual/suspicious driver activity, especially regarding EDR and drivers
associated with security tools as well as those that may be abused to disable
security products.
DS0022 File File Deletion Monitor for missing log ﬁles hosts and services with known active periods.
File Modiﬁcation Monitor changes made to conﬁguration ﬁles that contain settings for logging and
defensive tools.
DS0018 Firewall Firewall Disable Monitor for changes in the status of the system ﬁrewall such as Windows Security
Auditing events 5025 (The Windows ﬁrewall service has been stopped) and 5034
(The Windows ﬁrewall driver was stopped).
Firewall Rule
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to ﬁrewall rules for unexpected modiﬁcations to
allow/block speciﬁc network traﬃc that may maliciously modify components of a
victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.
DS0009 Process OS API Execution Monitor for the abnormal execution of API functions associated with system
logging.
Process Creation Monitor newly executed processes that may maliciously modify components of a
victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.
Process
ModiﬁcationUsing another process or third-party tools, monitor for modiﬁcations or access to
system processes associated with logging.
Process
TerminationMonitor for unexpected deletions of a running process (ex: Sysmon EID 5 or
Windows EID 4689) that may maliciously modify components of a victim
environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.
DS0012 Script Script Execution Monitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be
considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled,
scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are
suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the ﬁle system when possible to
determine their actions and intent.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Monitor logging, messaging, and other artifacts highlighting the health of host
sensors (ex: metrics, errors, and/or exceptions from logging applications) that may
maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or
disable defensive mechanisms. Lack of log events may be suspicious.
DS0019 Service Service Metadata Monitor contextual data about a service/daemon, which may include information
such as name, service executable, start type that that may maliciously modify
components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive
mechanisms.[5]

DS0002 User Account User Account
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes to account settings associated with users/tenants that may
impact defensive logging capabilities, such as the Update User and Change User
License events in the Azure AD audit log.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of windows registry keys that that may maliciously
modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive
mechanisms.
Windows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationMonitor Registry edits for modiﬁcations to services and startup programs that
correspond to security tools.
