https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001/ 3/5Web Service: Dead Drop Resolver
Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2)
infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often
obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.
Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a signiﬁcant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts
within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or
Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving
adversaries an added level of protection.
Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling
operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).Other sub-techniques of Web Service (3)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0096 APT41 APT41 used legitimate websites for C2 through dead drop resolvers (DDR), including GitHub, Pastebin, and
Microsoft TechNet.
S0373 Astaroth Astaroth can store C2 information on cloud hosting services such as AWS and CloudFlare and websites
like YouTube and Facebook.
S0128 BADNEWS BADNEWS collects C2 information via a dead drop resolver.
S0069 BLACKCOFFEE BLACKCOFFEE uses Microsoft’s TechNet Web portal to obtain a dead drop resolver containing an encoded
tag with the IP address of a command and control server.
G0060 BRONZE
BUTLERBRONZE BUTLER's MSGET downloader uses a dead drop resolver to access malicious payloads.
C0017 C0017 During C0017, APT41 used dead drop resolvers on two separate tech community forums for their
KEYPLUG Windows-version backdoor; notably APT41 updated the community forum posts frequently with
new dead drop resolvers during the campaign.
S0674 CharmPower CharmPower can retrieve C2 domain information from actor-controlled S3 buckets.
S0531 Grandoreiro Grandoreiro can obtain C2 information from Google Docs.
S0528 Javali Javali can read C2 information from Google Documents and YouTube.
S1051 KEYPLUG The KEYPLUG Windows variant has retrieved C2 addresses from encoded data in posts on tech
community forums.
S0455 Metamorfo Metamorfo has used YouTube to store and hide C&C server domains.
S0051 MiniDuke Some MiniDuke components use Twitter to initially obtain the address of a C2 server or as a backup if no
hard-coded C2 server responds.
G0040 Patchwork Patchwork hides base64-encoded and encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.
S0013 PlugX PlugX uses Pastebin to store C2 addresses.
S0518 PolyglotDuke PolyglotDuke can use Twitter, Reddit, Imgur and other websites to get a C2 URL.
G0106 Rocke Rocke has used Pastebin to check the version of beaconing malware and redirect to another Pastebin
hosting updated malware.
S0148 RTM RTM has used an RSS feed on Livejournal to update a list of encrypted C2 server names. RTM has also
hidden Pony C2 server IP addresses within transactions on the Bitcoin and Namecoin blockchain.
G0048 RTM RTM has used an RSS feed on Livejournal to update a list of encrypted C2 server names.
S0341 Xbash Xbash can obtain a webpage hosted on Pastebin to update its C2 domain list.[1]

ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce external network communication policy that prevents use of
unauthorized external services.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
