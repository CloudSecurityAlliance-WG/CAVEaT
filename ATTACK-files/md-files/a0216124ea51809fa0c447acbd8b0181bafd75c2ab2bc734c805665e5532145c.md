Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1037 Filter
Network
TraﬃcLeverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations to
ﬁlter traﬃc upstream from services. Filter boundary traﬃc by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack,
blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport. To defend against SYN
ﬂoods, enable SYN Cookies.Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for
managing the ﬁnite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These
attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an
OS self-imposes.
Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN ﬂoods and ACK ﬂoods. With SYN ﬂoods,
excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number
of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP
connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.
ACK ﬂoods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A ﬂood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its
state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist,
the OS will have to search the entire state table to conﬁrm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large ﬂood of packets,
the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the
rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.Other sub-techniques of Endpoint Denial of Service (4)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
DS0013 Sensor Health Host Status Detection of Endpoint DoS can sometimes be achieved before the effect is suﬃcient to
cause signiﬁcant impact to the availability of the service, but such response time
typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness. Monitor for logging,
messaging, and other artifacts highlighting the health of host sensors (ex: metrics, errors,
and/or exceptions from logging applications)
