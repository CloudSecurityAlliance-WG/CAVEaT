https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/ 3/17Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location
Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate ﬁles or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the
sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under
System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by
creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a ﬁle or container image
name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.
Adversaries may also use the same icon of the ﬁle they are trying to mimic.Other sub-techniques of Masquerading (9)

G1017 Volt Typhoon Volt Typhoon has used legitimate looking ﬁlenames for compressed copies of the ntds.dit database
and used names including cisco\_up.exe, cl64.exe, vm3dservice.exe, watchdogd.exe, Win.exe,
WmiPreSV.exe, and WmiPrvSE.exe for the Earthworm and Fast Reverse Proxy tools.
G0107 Whiteﬂy Whiteﬂy has named the malicious DLL the same name as DLLs belonging to legitimate software
from various security vendors.
S0141 Winnti for Windows A Winnti for Windows implant ﬁle was named ASPNET\_FILTER.DLL, mimicking the legitimate
ASP.NET ISAPI ﬁlter DLL with the same name.

M1045 Code Signing Require signed binaries and images.
M1038 Execution Prevention Use tools that restrict program execution via application control by attributes other than ﬁle
name for common operating system utilities that are needed.
M1022 Restrict File and Directory

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/ 12/17Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Collect ﬁle hashes; ﬁle names that do not match their expected hash are suspect. Perform ﬁle
monitoring; ﬁles with known names but in unusual locations are suspect. Likewise, ﬁles that
are modiﬁed outside of an update or patch are suspect.
DS0007 Image Image
MetadataIn containerized environments, use image IDs and layer hashes to compare images instead of
relying only on their names. Monitor for the unexpected creation of new resources within
your cluster in Kubernetes, especially those created by atypical users.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may match or approximate the name or location of
legitimate ﬁles or resources when naming/placing them. Looks for mismatches between
process names and their image paths.Malware authors often use this technique to hide
malicious executables behind legitimate Windows executable names
(e.g. lsass.exe, svchost.exe, etc).There are several sub-techniques, but this analytic focuses
on Match Legitimate Name or Location only.
Note: With process monitoring, hunt for processes matching these criteria:
process name is svchost.exe, smss.exe, wininit.exe, taskhost.exe, etc.
process path is not C:\Windows\System32\ or C:\Windows\SysWow64\
Examples (true positive):C:\Users\administrator\svchost.exe
To make sure the rule doesn’t miss cases where the executable would be started from a sub-
folder of these locations, the entire path is checked for the process path. The below example
should be considered as suspicious: C:\Windows\System32\srv\svchost.exe
Analytic 1 - Common Windows Process Masquerading
suspicious\_processes = filter processes where ( (exe=svchost.exe AND
(image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe" OR
process\_path!="C:\Windows\SysWow64\svchost.exe")) OR (exe=smss.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\smss.exe") OR (exe=wininit.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\wininit.exe") OR (exe=taskhost.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\taskhost.exe") OR (exe=lasass.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe") OR (exe=winlogon.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\winlogon.exe") OR (exe=csrss.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\csrss.exe") OR (exe=services.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\services.exe") OR (exe=lsm.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\System32\lsm.exe") OR (exe=explorer.exe AND
image\_path!="C:\Windows\explorer.exe"))
Process
MetadataCollecting and comparing disk and resource ﬁlenames for binaries by looking to see if the
InternalName, OriginalFilename, and/or ProductName match what is expected could provide
useful leads, but may not always be indicative of malicious activity.[186]3/22/24, 3:43 PM Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location, Sub-technique T1036.005 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
