https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005/ 3/5Obfuscated Files or Information: Indicator Removal from
Tools
Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed. They can
modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or
subsequent targets that may use similar systems.
A good example of this is when malware is detected with a ﬁle signature and quarantined by anti-virus software. An adversary who can
determine that the malware was quarantined because of its ﬁle signature may modify the ﬁle to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-
use the malware.Other sub-techniques of Obfuscated Files or Information (12)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0022 APT3 APT3 has been known to remove indicators of compromise from tools.
S0154 Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike includes a capability to modify the Beacon payload to eliminate known signatures or
unpacking methods.
S0187 Daserf Analysis of Daserf has shown that it regularly undergoes technical improvements to evade anti-virus
detection.
G0009 Deep Panda Deep Panda has updated and modiﬁed its malware, resulting in different hash values that evade detection.
G0093 GALLIUM GALLIUM ensured each payload had a unique hash, including by using different types of packers.
S0237 GravityRAT The author of GravityRAT submitted samples to VirusTotal for testing, showing that the author modiﬁed the
code to try to hide the DDE object in a different part of the document.
S0260 InvisiMole InvisiMole has undergone regular technical improvements in an attempt to evade detection.
G0049 OilRig OilRig has tested malware samples to determine AV detection and subsequently modiﬁed the samples to
ensure AV evasion.
C0014 Operation
WocaoDuring Operation Wocao, threat actors edited variable names within the Impacket suite to avoid automated
detection.
G0040 Patchwork Patchwork apparently altered NDiskMonitor samples by adding four bytes of random letters in a likely
attempt to change the ﬁle hashes.
S0587 Penquin Penquin can remove strings from binaries.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit's Find-AVSignature AntivirusBypass module can be used to locate single byte anti-virus
signatures.
S0650 QakBot QakBot can make small changes to itself in order to change its checksum and hash value.
S0559 SUNBURST SUNBURST source code used generic variable names and pre-obfuscated strings, and was likely sanitized
of developer comments before being added to SUNSPOT.
G0088 TEMP.Veles TEMP.Veles has modiﬁed ﬁles based on the open-source project cryptcat in an apparent attempt to decrease
AV detection rates.
G0010 Turla Based on comparison of Gazer versions, Turla made an effort to obfuscate strings in the malware that
could be used as IoCs, including the mutex name and named pipe.
S0579 Waterbear Waterbear can scramble functions not to be executed again with random values.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.[1]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentThe ﬁrst detection of a malicious tool may trigger an anti-virus or other security tool
alert. Similar events may also occur at the boundary through network IDS, email
scanning appliance, etc. The initial detection should be treated as an indication of a
potentially more invasive intrusion. The alerting system should be thoroughly
investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may
continue with an operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will
not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link that event to
other activity occurring on the network.
