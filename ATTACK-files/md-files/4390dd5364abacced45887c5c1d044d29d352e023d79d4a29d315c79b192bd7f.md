Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0600 Doki Doki was run through a deployed container.
S0599 Kinsing Kinsing was run through a deployed Ubuntu container.
S0683 Peirates Peirates can deploy a pod that mounts its node’s root ﬁle system, then execute a command to create a reverse
shell on the node.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has deployed different types of containers into victim environments to facilitate execution.
TeamTNT has also transferred cryptocurrency mining software to Kubernetes clusters discovered within local IP
address ranges.Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a
new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download
malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container conﬁgured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing
defenses within the environment.
Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the
Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeﬂow. Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign
images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.[1][2][3]

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Scan images before deployment, and block those that are not in compliance with security policies. In
Kubernetes environments, the admission controller can be used to validate images after a container
deployment request is authenticated but before the container is deployed.
M1035 Limit Access to
Resource Over
NetworkLimit communications with the container service to managed and secured channels, such as local Unix
sockets or remote access via SSH. Require secure port access to communicate with the APIs over TLS by
disabling unauthenticated access to the Docker API, Kubernetes API Server, and container orchestration
web applications. In Kubernetes clusters deployed in cloud environments, use native cloud
platform features to restrict the IP ranges that are permitted to access to API server. Where possible,
consider enabling just-in-time (JIT) access to the Kubernetes API to place additional restrictions on
access.
M1030 Network
SegmentationDeny direct remote access to internal systems through the use of network proxies, gateways, and
ﬁrewalls.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnforce the principle of least privilege by limiting container dashboard access to only the necessary
users. When using Kubernetes, avoid giving users wildcard permissions or adding users to the
system:masters group, and use RoleBindings rather than ClusterRoleBindings to limit user
privileges to speciﬁc namespaces.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentConﬁguration management databases (CMDB) and other asset management
systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that
should not exist on a network.
DS0032 Container Container
CreationMonitor for newly constructed containers that may deploy a container into an
environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.
Container Start Monitor for activation or invocation of a container that may deploy a container into an
environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.
DS0014 Pod Pod Creation Monitor for newly constructed pods that may deploy a container into an environment
to facilitate execution or evade defenses.
Pod Modiﬁcation Monitor for changes made to pods for unexpected modiﬁcations to settings and/or
control data that may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or
evade defenses.[11]
