https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003/ 3/10Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from
Web Browsers
Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading ﬁles speciﬁc to the target browser. Web browsers commonly save
credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers typically
store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web
browsers.
For example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database ﬁle,
AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data and executing a SQL query: SELECT action\_url, username\_value,
password\_value FROM logins; . The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API
function CryptUnprotectData , which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key.
Adversaries have executed similar procedures for common web browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc. Windows stores Internet
Explorer and Microsoft Edge credentials in Credential Lockers managed by the Windows Credential Manager.
Adversaries may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns that commonly match credentials.
After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and/or accounts
in order to expand access. This can result in signiﬁcantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web
browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).Other sub-techniques of Credentials from Password Stores (6)
