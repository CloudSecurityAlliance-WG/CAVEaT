Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0687 Cyclops
BlinkCyclops Blink has maintained persistence by patching legitimate device ﬁrmware when it is downloaded,
including that of WatchGuard devices.
G0020 Equation Equation is known to have the capability to overwrite the ﬁrmware on hard drives from some manufacturers.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1051 Update Software Perform regular ﬁrmware updates to mitigate risks of exploitation and/or abuse.Adversaries may modify component ﬁrmware to persist on systems. Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise
computer components and install malicious ﬁrmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system
ﬁrmware or BIOS. This technique may be similar to System Firmware but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not
have the same capability or level of integrity checking.
Malicious component ﬁrmware could provide both a persistent level of access to systems despite potential typical failures to maintain
access and hard disk re-images, as well as a way to evade host software-based defenses and integrity checks.Other sub-techniques of Pre-OS Boot (5)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0027 Driver Driver Metadata Monitor for unexpected disk partition table entries, or blocks of otherwise unusual memory
that warrant deeper investigation
DS0001 Firmware Firmware
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes that may reveal indicators of malicious ﬁrmware such as strings. Also
consider comparing components, including hashes of component ﬁrmware and behavior,
against known good images.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with the use of device drivers and/or provided by SMART
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) disk monitoring may reveal
malicious manipulations of components. Otherwise, this technique may be diﬃcult to detect
since malicious activity is taking place on system components possibly outside the purview
of OS security and integrity mechanisms.
