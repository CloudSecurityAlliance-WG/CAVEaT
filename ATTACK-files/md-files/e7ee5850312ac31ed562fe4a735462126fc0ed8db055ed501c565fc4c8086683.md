Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0504 Anchor Anchor can install itself as a cron job.
G0082 APT38 APT38 has used cron to create pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs on a Linux system.
S0401 Exaramel for Linux Exaramel for Linux uses crontab for persistence if it does not have root privileges.
S0588 GoldMax The GoldMax Linux variant has used a crontab entry with a @reboot line to gain persistence.
S0163 Janicab Janicab used a cron job for persistence on Mac devices.
S0599 Kinsing Kinsing has used crontab to download and run shell scripts every minute to ensure persistence.
S0198 NETWIRE NETWIRE can use crontabs to establish persistence.
S0587 Penquin Penquin can use Cron to create periodic and pre-scheduled background jobs.
G0106 Rocke Rocke installed a cron job that downloaded and executed ﬁles from the C2.
S0468 Skidmap Skidmap has installed itself via crontab.
S0374 SpeakUp SpeakUp uses cron tasks to ensure persistence. 
S0341 Xbash Xbash can create a cronjob for persistence if it determines it is on a Linux system.Adversaries may abuse the cron utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The cron utility is a
time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems. The crontab ﬁle contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the speciﬁed
times for execution. Any crontab ﬁles are stored in operating system-speciﬁc ﬁle paths.
An adversary may use cron in Linux or Unix environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence.Other sub-techniques of Scheduled Task/Job (5)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Review changes to the cron schedule. cron execution can be reviewed within the /var/log directory.
To validate the location of the cron log ﬁle, check the syslog conﬁg at /etc/rsyslog.conf or
/etc/syslog.conf
M1018 User Account
Managementcron permissions are controlled by /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny . If there is a cron.allow
ﬁle, then the user or users that need to use cron will need to be listed in the ﬁle. cron.deny is used to
explicitly disallow users from using cron. If neither ﬁles exist, then only the super user is allowed to run
cron.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed atq command and ensure IP addresses stored in the
SSH\_CONNECTION and SSH\_CLIENT variables, machines that created the jobs, are
trusted hosts. All at jobs are stored in /var/spool/cron/atjobs/.
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to ﬁles for unexpected modiﬁcations to access permissions
and attributes
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that executed through
scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when
compared against historical data. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but
as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network
connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment
through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.
DS0003 Scheduled Job Scheduled Job
CreationMonitor for newly constructed scheduled jobs. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be
created during installation of new software or through system administration functions.
Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc.
