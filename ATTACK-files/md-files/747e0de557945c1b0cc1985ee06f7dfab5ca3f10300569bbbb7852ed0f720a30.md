Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1091 Pacu Pacu can allowlist IP addresses in AWS GuardDuty.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Routinely check account role permissions to ensure only expected users and roles have permission
to modify cloud ﬁrewalls.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnsure least privilege principles are applied to Identity and Access Management (IAM) security
policies.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0018 Firewall Firewall Disable Monitor for changes in the status of the system ﬁrewall such as Windows Security
Auditing events 5025 (The Windows ﬁrewall service has been stopped) and 5034 (The
Windows ﬁrewall driver was stopped).
Firewall Rule
ModiﬁcationMonitor cloud logs for modiﬁcation or creation of new security groups or ﬁrewall rules.Adversaries may disable or modify a ﬁrewall within a cloud environment to bypass controls that limit access to cloud resources. Cloud
ﬁrewalls are separate from system ﬁrewalls that are described in Disable or Modify System Firewall.
Cloud environments typically utilize restrictive security groups and ﬁrewall rules that only allow network activity from trusted IP addresses
via expected ports and protocols. An adversary may introduce new ﬁrewall rules or policies to allow access into a victim cloud environment.
For example, an adversary may use a script or utility that creates new ingress rules in existing security groups to allow any TCP/IP
connectivity, or remove networking limitations to support traﬃc associated with malicious activity (such as cryptomining).
Modifying or disabling a cloud ﬁrewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exﬁltration that would
otherwise not be allowed.Other sub-techniques of Impair Defenses (11)
