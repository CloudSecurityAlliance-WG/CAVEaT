Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0281 Dok Dok proxies web traﬃc to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP(S) traﬃc.
G0094 Kimsuky Kimsuky has used modiﬁed versions of PHProxy to examine web traﬃc between the victim and the accessed
website.Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique
to support follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniﬃng, Transmitted Data Manipulation, or replay attacks (Exploitation for Credential
Access). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the ﬂow of network traﬃc (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.),
adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform
additional actions.
For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from
accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware. Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in
order to intercept user credentials and session cookies. Downgrade Attacks can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by
negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.
Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traﬃc, such as in Transmitted Data Manipulation.
Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traﬃc from ﬂowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to Impair Defenses
and/or in support of a Network Denial of Service.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramDisable legacy network protocols that may be used to intercept network traﬃc if applicable,
especially those that are not needed within an environment.
M1041 Encrypt Sensitive
InformationEnsure that all wired and/or wireless traﬃc is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for
authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure web traﬃc that may contain credentials is
protected by SSL/TLS.
M1037 Filter Network Traﬃc Use network appliances and host-based security software to block network traﬃc that is not
necessary within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM
conditions.
M1035 Limit Access to
Resource Over NetworkLimit access to network infrastructure and resources that can be used to reshape traﬃc or
otherwise produce AiTM conditions.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traﬃc patterns indicative of
AiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
M1030 Network Segmentation Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad
network access. This may mitigate, or at least alleviate, the scope of AiTM activity.
M1017 User Training Train users to be suspicious about certiﬁcate errors. Adversaries may use their own certiﬁcates in
an attempt to intercept HTTPS traﬃc. Certiﬁcate errors may arise when the application’s certiﬁcate
does not match the one expected by the host.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor application logs for changes to settings and other events associated with
network protocols and other services commonly abused for AiTM.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor network traﬃc for anomalies associated with known AiTM behavior.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor for network traﬃc originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.
Local network traﬃc metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage
of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying
hardware.
DS0019 Service Service Creation Monitor for newly constructed services/daemons through Windows event logs for
event IDs 4697 and 7045. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as
part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as remote logins
or process creation events.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationMonitor HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient for changes to
the "EnableMulticast" DWORD value. A value of "0" indicates LLMNR is disabled.[12]3/22/24, 3:46 PM Adversary-in-the-Middle, Technique T1557 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
