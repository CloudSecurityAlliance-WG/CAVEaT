https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002/ 3/9Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User
Account Control
Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program
to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions,
possibly by prompting the user for conﬁrmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to
allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an
administrator password to complete the action.
If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute
some elevated Component Object Model objects without prompting the user through the UAC notiﬁcation box. An example of this is use
of Rundll32 to load a speciﬁcally crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated Component Object Model object and performs a ﬁle operation in
a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain
elevated privileges without prompting a user.
Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods that have
been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered
and some used in the wild, such as:
eventvwr.exe can auto-elevate and execute a speciﬁed binary or script.
Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known,
since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on
remote systems and default to high integrity.Other sub-techniques of Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (5)

Threat actors often, after compromising a machine, try to disable User Access Control
(UAC) to escalate privileges. This is often done by changing the registry key for
system policies using "reg.exe", a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for modifying
the registry via command prompt or scripts. This action interferes with UAC and may
enable a threat actor to escalate privileges on the compromised system, thereby
allowing further exploitation of the system.
Analytic 1 : UAC Bypass
possible\_uac\_bypass = filter processes where ( integrity\_level ==
"High" and (parent\_image\_path == "c:\windows\system32\fodhelper.exe") or
(command\_line == " .exe\"cleanmgr.exe /autoclean ") or (image\_path ==
"c:\program files\windows media player\osk.exe") or (parent\_image\_path
== "c:\windows\system32\slui.exe") or (parent\_command\_line ==
'"c:\windows\system32\dism.exe" "".xml"' and image\_path !=
"c:\users\*\appdata\local\temp\*\dismhost.exe") or (command\_line ==
'"c:\windows\system32\wusa.exe" /quiet\*' and user != "NOT\_TRANSLATED" and
current\_working\_directory == "c:\windows\system32\" and
parent\_image\_path != "c:\windows\explorer.exe") or (parent\_image\_path ==
"c:\windows\*dccw.exe" and image\_path !=
"c:\windows\system32\cttune.exe"))
Analytic 2 : Disable UAC
cmd\_processes = filter processes where ( (parent\_image =
"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe") AND (command\_line =
"reg.exe%HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System%
REG\_DWORD /d 0%"))
Process
MetadataMonitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information
such as environment variables, image name, user/owner that may bypass UAC
mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
ModiﬁcationSome UAC bypass methods rely on modifying speciﬁc, user-accessible Registry
settings. For example:\* The eventvwr.exe bypass uses the
[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command Registry
key.\* The sdclt.exe bypass uses the
[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
Paths\control.exe and
[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolat
edCommand Registry keys. Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for
unauthorized changes.
UAC Bypass is an interesting technique in that new implementations are regularly
found and existing implementations may be ﬁxed (i.e., patched) by Microsoft in new
builds of Windows. Therefore, it is important to validate than detections for UAC
Bypass are still relevant (i.e., they target non-patched implementations).
Note: Sysmon Event ID 12 (Registry Key Create/Delete), Sysmon Event ID 13 (Registry
Value Set), and Sysmon Event ID 14 (Registry Key and Value Rename) are useful for
creating detections around Registry Key Modiﬁcation in the context of UAC Bypass.[6]
