Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0128 BADNEWS After encrypting C2 data, BADNEWS converts it into a hexadecimal representation and then encodes it into
base64.
S0132 H1N1 H1N1 obfuscates C2 traﬃc with an altered version of base64.
S0362 Linux
RabbitLinux Rabbit sends the payload from the C2 server as an encoded URL parameter. 
S0699 Mythic Mythic provides various transform functions to encode and/or randomize C2 data.
S0386 Ursnif Ursnif has used encoded data in HTTP URLs for C2.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for
unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the speciﬁc obfuscation technique used by a
particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions.
Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid
detection by common defensive tools. Adversaries may encode data to make the content of command and control traﬃc more diﬃcult to detect. Command and control (C2)
information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system. Use of data encoding may adhere to existing protocol speciﬁcations
and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other binary-to-text and character encoding systems. Some data encoding
systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip.Sub-techniques (2)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor for network data for uncommon data ﬂows (e.g., a client sending signiﬁcantly
more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not
normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.
Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected
protocol behavior for the port that is being used.
Note: Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and
alert on network protocols and packet contents.
