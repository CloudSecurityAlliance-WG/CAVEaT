Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0092 Agent.btz Agent.btz creates a ﬁle named thumb.dd on all USB ﬂash drives connected to the victim. This ﬁle contains
information about the infected system and activity logs.
S0409 Machete Machete has a feature to copy ﬁles from every drive onto a removable drive in a hidden folder.
G0129 Mustang
PandaMustang Panda has used a customized PlugX variant which could exﬁltrate documents from air-gapped
networks.
S0125 Remsec Remsec contains a module to move data from airgapped networks to Internet-connected systems by using a
removable USB device.
S0035 SPACESHIP SPACESHIP copies staged data to removable drives when they are inserted into the system.
G0081 Tropic Trooper Tropic Trooper has exﬁltrated data using USB storage devices.
S0136 USBStealer USBStealer exﬁltrates collected ﬁles via removable media from air-gapped victims.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1057 Data Loss Prevention Data loss prevention can detect and block sensitive data being copied to USB devices.
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramDisable Autorun if it is unnecessary. Disallow or restrict removable media at an
organizational policy level if they are not required for business operations. 
M1034 Limit Hardware
InstallationLimit the use of USB devices and removable media within a network.Adversaries may attempt to exﬁltrate data over a USB connected physical device. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network
compromise, exﬁltration could occur via a USB device introduced by a user. The USB device could be used as the ﬁnal exﬁltration point or to
hop between otherwise disconnected systems.
