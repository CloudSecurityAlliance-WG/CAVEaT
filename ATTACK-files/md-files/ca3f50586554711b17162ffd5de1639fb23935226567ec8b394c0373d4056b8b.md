Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has relied on users to download and execute malicious Docker images.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Audit images deployed within the environment to ensure they do not contain any malicious
components.
M1045 Code Signing Utilize a trust model such as Docker Content Trust with digital signatures to ensure runtime
veriﬁcation of the integrity and publisher of speciﬁc image tags.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork prevention intrusion systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious
downloads can be used to block activity.
M1017 User Training Train users to be aware of the existence of malicious images and how to avoid deploying instances
and containers from them.Adversaries may rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images
(AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be backdoored.
Backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via Upload Malware, and users may then download and deploy an instance or
container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that speciﬁcally achieve Initial Access. This
can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.
Adversaries may also name images a certain way to increase the chance of users mistakenly deploying an instance or container from the
image (ex: Match Legitimate Name or Location).Other sub-techniques of User Execution (3)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to take advantage of a
weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or
commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior.
DS0032 Container Container
CreationTrack the deployment of new containers, especially from newly built images.
Container Start Monitor the behavior of containers within the environment to detect anomalous
behavior or malicious activity after users deploy from malicious images.
DS0007 Image Image Creation Monitor the local image registry to make sure malicious images are not added.
DS0030 Instance Instance Creation Monitor for newly constructed instances that may attempt to take advantage of a
weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or
commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior.
Instance Start Monitor for the activation or invocation of an instance (ex: instance.start within GCP
