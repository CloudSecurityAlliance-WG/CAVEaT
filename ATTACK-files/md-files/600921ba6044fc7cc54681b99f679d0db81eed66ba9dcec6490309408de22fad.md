Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1013 Application
Developer GuidanceApplication developers uploading to public code repositories should be careful to avoid publishing
sensitive information such as credentials and API keys.
M1047 Audit Scan public code repositories for exposed credentials or other sensitive information before making
commits. Ensure that any leaked credentials are removed from the commit history, not just the current
latest version of the code.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.Adversaries may search freely available websites and/or domains for information about victims that can be used during targeting.
Information about victims may be available in various online sites, such as social media, new sites, or those hosting information about
business operations such as hiring or requested/rewarded contracts.
Adversaries may search in different online sites depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources may
reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing
operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Phishing).Sub-techniques (3)
