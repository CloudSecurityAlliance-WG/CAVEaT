Search Open Technical Databases: Digital Certiﬁcates
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the
visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.
ReferencesAdversaries may search public digital certiﬁcate data for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Digital certiﬁcates are
issued by a certiﬁcate authority (CA) in order to cryptographically verify the origin of signed content. These certiﬁcates, such as those used
for encrypted web traﬃc (HTTPS SSL/TLS communications), contain information about the registered organization such as name and
location.
Adversaries may search digital certiﬁcate data to gather actionable information. Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to
harvest information about certiﬁcates. Digital certiﬁcate data may also be available from artifacts signed by the organization (ex:
certiﬁcates used from encrypted web traﬃc are served with content). Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other
forms of reconnaissance (ex: Active Scanning or Phishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or
Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Trusted Relationship).Other sub-techniques of Search Open Technical Databases (5)
