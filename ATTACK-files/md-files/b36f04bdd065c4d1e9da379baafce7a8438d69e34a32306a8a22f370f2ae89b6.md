Supply Chain
Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a ﬁnal consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Supply
chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of the application source code, manipulation of
the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled releases with a modiﬁed version.
Targeting may be speciﬁc to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on
speciﬁc victims.Other sub-techniques of Supply Chain Compromise (3)

ID Name Description
G0096 APT41 APT41 gained access to production environments where they could inject malicious code into
legitimate, signed ﬁles and widely distribute them to end users.
S0222 CCBkdr CCBkdr was added to a legitimate, signed version 5.33 of the CCleaner software and distributed on
CCleaner's distribution site.
G0080 Cobalt Group Cobalt Group has compromised legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor. 
G0035 Dragonﬂy Dragonﬂy has placed trojanized installers for control system software on legitimate vendor app stores.
G0046 FIN7 FIN7 has gained initial access by compromising a victim's software supply chain.
G0115 GOLD
SOUTHFIELDGOLD SOUTHFIELD has distributed ransomware by backdooring software installers via a strategic web
compromise of the site hosting Italian WinRAR.

software M.E.Doc and replacing a legitimate software update with a malicious one.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 gained initial network access to some victims via a
trojanized update of SolarWinds Orion software.
S0562 SUNSPOT SUNSPOT malware was designed and used to insert SUNBURST into software builds of the SolarWinds
Orion IT management product.

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1051 Update Software A patch management process should be implemented to check unused applications, unmaintained
and/or previously vulnerable software, unnecessary features, components, ﬁles, and documentation.
M1016 Vulnerability
ScanningContinuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools
should also be implemented as well.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Use veriﬁcation of distributed binaries through hash checking or other integrity checking
mechanisms. Scan downloads for malicious signatures and attempt to test software and
updates prior to deployment while taking note of potential suspicious activity.[3]
