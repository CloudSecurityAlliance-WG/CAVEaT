https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/002/ 3/4Data Obfuscation: Steganography
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0001 Axiom Axiom has used steganography to hide its C2 communications.
S0187 Daserf Daserf can use steganography to hide malicious code downloaded to the victim.
S0038 Duqu When the Duqu command and control is operating over HTTP or HTTPS, Duqu uploads data to its
controller by appending it to a blank JPG ﬁle.
S0037 HAMMERTOSS HAMMERTOSS is controlled via commands that are appended to image ﬁles.
S0395 LightNeuron LightNeuron is controlled via commands that are embedded into PDFs and JPGs using steganographic
methods.
C0023 Operation
GhostDuring Operation Ghost, APT29 used steganography to hide the communications between the implants
and their C&C servers.
S0495 RDAT RDAT can process steganographic images attached to email messages to send and receive C2 commands.
RDAT can also embed additional messages within BMP images to communicate with the RDAT operator.
S0633 Sliver Sliver can encode binary data into a .PNG ﬁle for C2 communication.
S0559 SUNBURST SUNBURST C2 data attempted to appear as benign XML related to .NET assemblies or as a faux JSON
blob.
S0230 ZeroT ZeroT has retrieved stage 2 payloads as Bitmap images that use Least Signiﬁcant Bit (LSB)
steganography.
S0672 Zox Zox has used the .PNG ﬁle format for C2 communications.Adversaries may use steganographic techniques to hide command and control traﬃc to make detection efforts more diﬃcult.
Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems. This hidden information can
be used for command and control of compromised systems. In some cases, the passing of ﬁles embedded using steganography, such as
image or document ﬁles, can be used for command and control.Other sub-techniques of Data Obfuscation (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate some obfuscation activity at the network level.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s),
leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traﬃc, that do not follow the expected
protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to
established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns, anomalous syntax, or
structure).
