https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003/ 3/6Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management
Instrumentation Event Subscription
Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription. WMI can be used to install event ﬁlters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code
when a deﬁned event occurs. Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user loging, or the computer's uptime.
Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing
persistence on a system. Adversaries may also compile WMI scripts into Windows Management Object (MOF) ﬁles (.mof extension) that
can be used to create a malicious subscription.
WMI subscription execution is proxied by the WMI Provider Host process (WmiPrvSe.exe) and thus may result in elevated SYSTEM
privileges.Other sub-techniques of Event Triggered Execution (16)

ID Name Description
S0202 adbupd adbupd can use a WMI script to achieve persistence.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has used WMI event subscriptions for persistence.
G0064 APT33 APT33 has attempted to use WMI event subscriptions to establish persistence on compromised hosts.
S1081 BADHATCH BADHATCH can use WMI event subscriptions for persistence.
G0108 Blue Mockingbird Blue Mockingbird has used mofcomp.exe to establish WMI Event Subscription persistence
mechanisms conﬁgured from a \*.mof ﬁle.
G0061 FIN8 FIN8 has used WMI event subscriptions for persistence.
G0065 Leviathan Leviathan has used WMI for persistence.
G1013 Metador Metador has established persistence through the use of a WMI event subscription combined with
unusual living-off-the-land binaries such as cdb.exe .
S1059 metaMain metaMain registered a WMI event subscription consumer called "hard\_disk\_stat" to establish
persistence.
G0129 Mustang Panda Mustang Panda's custom ORat tool uses a WMI event consumer to maintain persistence.
C0023 Operation Ghost During Operation Ghost, APT29 used WMI event subscriptions to establish persistence for malware.
S0378 PoshC2 PoshC2 has the ability to persist on a system using WMI events.
S0150 POSHSPY POSHSPY uses a WMI event subscription to establish persistence.
S0371 POWERTON POWERTON can use WMI for persistence.
S0511 RegDuke RegDuke can persist using a WMI consumer that is launched every time a process named
WINWORD.EXE is started.
S1085 Sardonic Sardonic can use a WMI event ﬁlter to invoke a command-line event consumer to gain persistence.
S0053 SeaDuke SeaDuke uses an event ﬁlter in WMI code to execute a previously dropped executable shortly after
system startup.
S0692 SILENTTRINITY SILENTTRINITY can create a WMI Event to execute a payload for persistence.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used a WMI event ﬁlter to invoke a command-line event
consumer at system boot time to launch a backdoor with rundll32.exe .
S0682 TrailBlazer TrailBlazer has the ability to use WMI for persistence.
G0010 Turla Turla has used WMI event ﬁlters and consumers to establish persistence.[6]

ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent malware from abusing
WMI to attain persistence.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementPrevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts.
M1018 User Account
ManagementBy default, only administrators are allowed to connect remotely using WMI; restrict other users that
are allowed to connect, or disallow all users from connecting remotely to WMI.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that can be used to register WMI persistence,
such as the Register-WmiEvent PowerShell cmdlet 
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that result from the execution of subscriptions (i.e.
spawning from the WmiPrvSe.exe WMI Provider Host process).
Note: Windows Event ID 4688 (A new process has been created) and Sysmon Event ID 1
(Process creation) can be used to alert on processes created by WMI event subscription
triggers by ﬁltering on events with a parent process name of WmiPrvSe.exe.
DS0005 WMI WMI Creation Monitor WMI event subscription entries, comparing current WMI event subscriptions to known
good subscriptions for each host. Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to
detect WMI changes that could be attempts at persistence. Monitor for the creation of
new WMI EventFilter , EventConsumer , and FilterToConsumerBinding events. Event ID
5861 is logged on Windows 10 systems when new EventFilterToConsumerBinding events
are created.[25]
