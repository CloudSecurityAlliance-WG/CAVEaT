Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramConsider removing previous versions of tools that are unnecessary to the environment when
possible.
M1054 Software Conﬁguration Consider implementing policies on internal web servers, such HTTP Strict Transport Security, that
enforce the use of HTTPS/network traﬃc encryption to prevent insecure connections.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor for commands or other activity that may be indicative of attempts to abuse older or
deprecated technologies (ex: powershell –v 2 ).
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may downgrade or use a version of system features
that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such as
logging.
Process
MetadataMonitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as
environment variables, image name, user/owner, or other information that may reveal use of a
version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated
security controls such as logging. For example, monitoring for Windows event ID (EID) 400,
speciﬁcally the EngineVersion ﬁeld which shows the version of PowerShell running, may
highlight a malicious downgrade attack.Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security
controls. Downgrade attacks typically take advantage of a system’s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation.
Adversaries may downgrade and use various less-secure versions of features of a system, such as Command and Scripting Interpreters or
even network protocols that can be abused to enable Adversary-in-the-Middle or Network Sniﬃng. For example, PowerShell versions 5+
includes Script Block Logging (SBL) which can record executed script content. However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous
version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to Impair Defenses while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise
been detected.
Adversaries may similarly target network traﬃc to downgrade from an encrypted HTTPS connection to an unsecured HTTP connection that
exposes network data in clear text.Other sub-techniques of Impair Defenses (11)
