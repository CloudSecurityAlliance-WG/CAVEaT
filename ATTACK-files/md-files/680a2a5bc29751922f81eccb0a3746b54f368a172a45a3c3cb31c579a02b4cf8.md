Token
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0154 Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike can make tokens from known credentials.
G1016 FIN13 FIN13 has utilized tools such as Incognito V2 for token manipulation and impersonation.
S1060 Mafalda Mafalda can create a token for a different user.Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary
has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using
the LogonUser function. The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use SetThreadToken to
assign the token to a thread.
This behavior is distinct from Token Impersonation/Theft in that this refers to creating a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an
existing one.Other sub-techniques of Access Token Manipulation (5)

ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementLimit permissions so that users and user groups cannot create tokens. This setting should be deﬁned for
the local system account only. GPO: Computer Conﬁguration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security
Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Create a token object. Also deﬁne who can create a
process level token to only the local and network service through GPO: Computer Conﬁguration >
[Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Replace a
process level token.
Administrators should log in as a standard user but run their tools with administrator privileges using the
built-in access token manipulation command runas .
M1018 User Account
ManagementAn adversary must already have administrator level access on the local system to make full use of this
technique; be sure to restrict users and accounts to the least privileges they require.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments to detect token manipulation by auditing
command-line activity. Speciﬁcally, analysts should look for use of the runas command or
similar artifacts. Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows.
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with detecting token manipulation only through careful
analysis of user activity, examination of running processes, and correlation with other
endpoint and network behavior, such as LogonUser and SetThreadToken. Correlate activity
with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives that may be due to normal benign
use by users and administrators
