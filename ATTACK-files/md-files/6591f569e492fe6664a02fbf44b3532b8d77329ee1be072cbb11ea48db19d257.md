Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
C0025 2016 Ukraine Electric
Power AttackDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team masqueraded executables as
.txt ﬁles.
S1074 ANDROMEDA ANDROMEDA has been delivered through a LNK ﬁle disguised as a folder.
S1053 AvosLocker AvosLocker has been disguised as a .jpg ﬁle.
S1063 Brute Ratel C4 Brute Ratel C4 has used Microsoft Word icons to hide malicious LNK ﬁles.
C0022 Operation Dream Job During Operation Dream Job, Lazarus Group disguised malicious template ﬁles as JPEG ﬁles
to avoid detection.
S0352 OSX\_OCEANLOTUS.D OSX\_OCEANLOTUS.D has disguised it's true ﬁle structure as an application bundle by adding
special characters to the ﬁlename and using the icon for legitimate Word documents.
S0650 QakBot The QakBot payload has been disguised as a PNG ﬁle and hidden within LNK ﬁles using a
Microsoft File Explorer icon.
G1017 Volt Typhoon Volt Typhoon has appended copies of the ntds.dit database with a .gif ﬁle extension.Adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate ﬁles through changes to the payload's formatting, including the ﬁle’s
signature, extension, and contents. Various ﬁle types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and organized. For
example, a ﬁle’s signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of a ﬁle and is often used to identify the ﬁle’s type.
For example, the header of a JPEG ﬁle, is 0xFF 0xD8 and the ﬁle extension is either .JPE , .JPEG or .JPG .
Adversaries may edit the header’s hex code and/or the ﬁle extension of a malicious payload in order to bypass ﬁle validation checks and/or
input sanitization. This behavior is commonly used when payload ﬁles are transferred (e.g., Ingress Tool Transfer) and stored (e.g., Upload
Malware) so that adversaries may move their malware without triggering detections.
Common non-executable ﬁle types and extensions, such as text ﬁles (.txt ) and image ﬁles (.jpg , .gif , etc.) may be typically treated as
benign. Based on this, adversaries may use a ﬁle extension to disguise malware, such as naming a PHP backdoor code with a ﬁle name of
test.gif . A user may not know that a ﬁle is malicious due to the benign appearance and ﬁle extension.
Polygot ﬁles, which are ﬁles that have multiple different ﬁle types and that function differently based on the application that will execute
them, may also be used to disguise malicious malware and capabilities.Other sub-techniques of Masquerading (9)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/008/ 4/4Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Anti-virus can be used to automatically quarantine suspicious ﬁles.
M1040 Behavior Prevention on
EndpointImplement security controls on the endpoint, such as a Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS),
to identify and prevent execution of ﬁles with mismatching ﬁle signatures.
M1038 Execution Prevention Ensure that input sanitization is performed and that ﬁles are validated properly before execution;
furthermore, implement a strict allow list to ensure that only authorized ﬁle types are processed.
 Restrict and/or block execution of ﬁles where headers and extensions do not match.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor for abnormal command execution from otherwise non-executable ﬁle types (such as
.txt and .jpg ).
DS0022 File File Modiﬁcation Check and ensure that ﬁle headers/signature and extensions match using magic bytes
detection and/or ﬁle signature validation. In Linux, the file command may be used to
check the ﬁle signature.
