Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house,
adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them. Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software (including licenses),
exploits, certiﬁcates, and information relating to vulnerabilities. Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout
numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.
In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-
party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from
individuals.
In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries may steal capabilities from third-party entities (including other adversaries). This can
include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing certiﬁcates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits.Sub-techniques (6)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0037 Certiﬁcate Certiﬁcate
RegistrationConsider use of services that may aid in the tracking of newly issued certiﬁcates
and/or certiﬁcates in use on sites across the Internet. In some cases it may be
possible to pivot on known pieces of certiﬁcate information to uncover other
adversary infrastructure. Some server-side components of adversary tools may
have default values set for SSL/TLS certiﬁcates. Much of this activity will take
place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this
behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the
adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense Evasion or Command and Control.
DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentMonitor for logged network traﬃc in response to a scan showing both protocol
header and body values that may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used
during targeting. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the
target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may
be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense
Evasion or Command and Control.
DS0004 Malware RepositoryMalware
ContentConsider analyzing malware for features that may be associated with malware
providers, such as compiler used, debugging artifacts, code similarities, or even
group identiﬁers associated with speciﬁc Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offerings.
Malware repositories can also be used to identify additional samples associated
with the developers and the adversary utilizing their services. Identifying overlaps in
malware use by different adversaries may indicate malware was obtained by the
adversary rather than developed by them. In some cases, identifying overlapping
characteristics in malware used by different adversaries may point to a shared
quartermaster. Malware repositories can also be used to identify features of tool
use associated with an adversary, such as watermarks in Cobalt Strike payloads.
Malware
MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a malicious payload, such as compilation times,
ﬁle hashes, as well as watermarks or other identiﬁable conﬁguration information.
Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization,
making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be focused on
related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense Evasion or
Command and Control.
