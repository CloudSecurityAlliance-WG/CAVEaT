Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0002 Mimikatz Mimikatz’s LSADUMP::DCShadow module can be used to make AD updates by temporarily setting a computer to
be a DC.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.Adversaries may register a rogue Domain Controller to enable manipulation of Active Directory data. DCShadow may be used to create a
rogue Domain Controller (DC). DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by
registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC. Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and
replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.
Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Conﬁguration partition of the AD schema, which requires
Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash. 
This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products
(since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors). The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication
and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform SID-History Injection
and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence. [1]

ModiﬁcationLeverage AD directory synchronization (DirSync) to monitor changes to directory state
using AD replication cookies.  Also consider monitoring and alerting on the
replication of AD objects (Audit Detailed Directory Service Replication Events 4928 and
4929). 
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze network traﬃc associated with data replication (such as calls to
DrsAddEntry, DrsReplicaAdd, and especially GetNCChanges) between DCs as well as
to/from non DC hosts.  DC replication will naturally take place every 15 minutes
but can be triggered by an adversary or by legitimate urgent changes (ex: passwords).
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationInvestigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those
associated with services (beginning with "GC/") by computers not present in the DC
organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service
(DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235–4B06–11D1-AB04–
00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging. A rogue DC must authenticate as a
service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.
