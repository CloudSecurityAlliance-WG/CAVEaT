https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004/ 3/5Create or Modify System Process: Launch Daemon
Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist ﬁles
used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install,
are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS
initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist ﬁles found in
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and /Library/LaunchDaemons/ . Required Launch Daemons parameters include a Label to identify
the task, Program to provide a path to the executable, and RunAtLoad to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to
provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.
Adversaries may install a Launch Daemon conﬁgured to execute at startup by using the RunAtLoad parameter set to true and the
Program parameter set to the malicious executable path. The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating
system or benign software (i.e. Masquerading). When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions.
Additionally, system conﬁguration changes (such as the installation of third party package managing software) may cause folders such as
usr/local/bin to become globally writeable. So, it is possible for poor conﬁgurations to allow an adversary to modify executables
referenced by current Launch Daemon's plist ﬁles.Other sub-techniques of Create or Modify System Process (4)

ID Name Description
S0584 AppleJeus AppleJeus has placed a plist ﬁle within the LaunchDaemons folder and launched it manually.
S0482 Bundlore Bundlore can persist via a LaunchDaemon.
S0497 Dacls Dacls can establish persistence via a Launch Daemon.
S0690 Green Lambert Green Lambert can add a plist ﬁle in the Library/LaunchDaemons to establish persistence.
S0451 LoudMiner LoudMiner adds plist ﬁles with the naming format com.[random\_name].plist in the
/Library/LaunchDaemons folder with the RunAtLoad and KeepAlive keys set to true .
S0352 OSX\_OCEANLOTUS.D If running with root permissions, OSX\_OCEANLOTUS.D can create a persistence ﬁle in the folder
/Library/LaunchDaemons .
S0595 ThiefQuest When running with root privileges after a Launch Agent is installed, ThiefQuest installs a plist ﬁle to
the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder with the RunAtLoad key set to true establishing persistence
as a Launch Daemon. 
S0658 XCSSET XCSSET uses the ssh launchdaemon to elevate privileges, bypass system controls, and enable
remote access to the victim.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Use auditing tools capable of detecting folder permissions abuse opportunities on systems,
especially reviewing changes made to folders by third-party software.
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit privileges of user accounts and remediate Privilege Escalation vectors so only authorized
administrators can create new Launch Daemons.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionSome legitimate LaunchDaemons point to unsigned code that could be exploited. For Launch
Daemons with the RunAtLoad parameter set to true, ensure the Program parameter points to
signed code or executables are in alignment with enterprise policy. Some parameters are
interchangeable with others, such as Program and ProgramArguments parameters but one
must be present. 
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for new ﬁles added to the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ folder. The System
LaunchDaemons are protected by SIP.
File
ModiﬁcationMonitor ﬁles for changes that may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious
payloads as part of persistence.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute
malicious payloads as part of persistence.
DS0019 Service Service
CreationMonitor for newly constructed services may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute
malicious payloads as part of persistence.
Service
ModiﬁcationMonitor services for changes made to Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as
part of persistence.[8][9]
