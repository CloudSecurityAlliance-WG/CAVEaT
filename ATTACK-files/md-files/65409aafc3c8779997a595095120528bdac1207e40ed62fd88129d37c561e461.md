https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/ 3/6Remote Access Software
An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an interactive command and control channel to
target systems within networks. These services, such as VNC, Team Viewer , AnyDesk , ScreenConnect , LogMein , AmmyyAdmin , and other
remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, are commonly used as legitimate technical support software and may be allowed by
application control within a target environment.
Remote access software may be installed and used post-compromise as an alternate communications channel for redundant access or as a
way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system. They may also be used as a component of malware to
establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled system.
Adversaries may similarly abuse response features included in EDR and other defensive tools that enable remote access.
Installation of many remote access software may also include persistence (e.g., the software's installation routine creates a Windows
Service).[1][2][3]

ID Name Description
C0015 C0015 During C0015, the threat actors installed the AnyDesk remote desktop application onto the compromised
network.
C0018 C0018 During C0018, the threat actors used AnyDesk to transfer tools between systems.

laterally.
G0129 Mustang Panda Mustang Panda has installed TeamViewer on targeted systems.
C0002 Night Dragon During Night Dragon, threat actors used several remote administration tools as persistent inﬁltration
channels.
S0148 RTM RTM has the capability to download a VNC module from command and control (C2).
G0048 RTM RTM has used a modiﬁed version of TeamViewer and Remote Utilities for remote access.
G0034 Sandworm
TeamSandworm Team has used remote administration tools or remote industrial control system client
software for execution and to maliciously release electricity breakers.
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has established tmate sessions for C2 communications.
G0076 Thrip Thrip used a cloud-based remote access software called LogMeIn for their attacks.

ID Mitigation Description
M1038 Execution Prevention Use application control to mitigate installation and use of unapproved software that can be used
for remote access.
M1037 Filter Network Traﬃc Properly conﬁgure ﬁrewalls, application ﬁrewalls, and proxies to limit outgoing traﬃc to sites and
services used by remote access software.
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures may be able to
prevent traﬃc to remote access services.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious.
Analytic 1 - Suspicious Port Usage
suspicious\_ports = filter network\_traffic where ((protocol ="6" and
(serverPort = 5938 or serverPort = 6568 or serverPort = 5650 or serverPort
= 5655 or serverPort =5631)) or (protocol = "17" and (serverPort = 15000
and serverPort = 5632 )) or(httpHost = "remoteutilities.com"))
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for applications and processes related to remote admin software. Correlate
activity with other suspicious behavior that may reduce false positives if this type of
software is used by legitimate users and administrators. Domain Fronting may be used
in conjunction to avoid defenses. Adversaries will likely need to deploy and/or install
these remote software to compromised systems. It may be possible to detect or prevent
the installation of this type of software with host-based solutions.3/22/24, 3:52 PM Remote Access Software, Technique T1219 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
