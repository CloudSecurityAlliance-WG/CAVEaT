https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003/ 3/4Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0168 Gazer Gazer performs thread execution hijacking to inject its orchestrator into a running thread from a remote
process.
S0094 Trojan.Karagany Trojan.Karagany can inject a suspended thread of its own process into a new process and initiate via the
ResumeThread API.
S0579 Waterbear Waterbear can use thread injection to inject shellcode into the process of security software.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be conﬁgured to block some types of process injection based
on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate
privileges. Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can
then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL. A handle to an existing victim process is ﬁrst created with native Windows API
calls such as OpenThread . At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via
SuspendThread , VirtualAllocEx , WriteProcessMemory , SetThreadContext , then ResumeThread respectively.
This is very similar to Process Hollowing but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.
Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
elevated privileges. Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is
masked under a legitimate process.Other sub-techniques of Process Injection (12)

ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a
signiﬁcant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under
speciﬁc circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions
may be common and diﬃcult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such
as CreateRemoteThread , SuspendThread /SetThreadContext /ResumeThread , and those
that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as
VirtualAllocEx /WriteProcessMemory , may be used for this technique.
Process

order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Process
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to processes that may inject malicious code into hijacked
