Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementEnsure critical system ﬁles as well as those known to be abused by adversaries have restrictive
permissions and are owned by an appropriately privileged account, especially if access is not
required by users nor will inhibit system functionality.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory PermissionsApplying more restrictive permissions to ﬁles and directories could prevent adversaries from
modifying their access control lists. Additionally, ensure that user settings regarding local and
remote symbolic links are properly set or disabled where unneeded.Adversaries may modify ﬁle or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected ﬁles. File and
directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs conﬁgured by the ﬁle or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions.
File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions
(read, write, execute, etc.).
Modiﬁcations may include changing speciﬁc access rights, which may require taking ownership of a ﬁle or directory and/or elevated
permissions depending on the ﬁle or directory’s existing permissions. This may enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or
deleting speciﬁc ﬁles or directories. Speciﬁc ﬁle and directory modiﬁcations may be a required step for many techniques, such as
establishing Persistence via Accessibility Features, Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, Unix Shell Conﬁguration Modiﬁcation, or
tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/conﬁguration ﬁles via Hijack Execution Flow.
Adversaries may also change permissions of symbolic links. For example, malware (particularly ransomware) may modify symbolic links
and associated settings to enable access to ﬁles from local shortcuts with remote paths.Sub-techniques (2)

ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to ACLs and ﬁle/directory ownership. Many of the
commands used to modify ACLs and ﬁle/directory ownership are built-in system
utilities and may generate a high false positive alert rate, so compare against baseline
knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modiﬁcation events with
other indications of malicious activity where possible.

DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for newly executed processes that may modify ﬁle or directory
permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected ﬁles.
