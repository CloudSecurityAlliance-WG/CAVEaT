Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Periodically check the integrity of system image to ensure it has not been modiﬁed. 
M1046 Boot Integrity Enable secure boot features to validate the digital signature of the boot environment and system image
using a special purpose hardware device. If the validation check fails, the device will fail to boot preventing
loading of unauthorized software. 
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc protocols, such as TFTP, can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often
for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the speciﬁc technique used by a particular
adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various network conﬁgurations.

ModiﬁcationThere are no documented means for defenders to validate the operation of the ROMMON
outside of vendor support. If a network device is suspected of being compromised, contact
the vendor to assist in further investigation.Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) by loading an unauthorized ﬁrmware with adversary code to provide persistent access
and manipulate device behavior that is diﬃcult to detect. 
ROMMON is a Cisco network device ﬁrmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software
when the platform is powered on or reset. Similar to TFTP Boot, an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely (for
example, through TFTP) with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image. This provides
adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be diﬃcult to detect.Other sub-techniques of Pre-OS Boot (5)
