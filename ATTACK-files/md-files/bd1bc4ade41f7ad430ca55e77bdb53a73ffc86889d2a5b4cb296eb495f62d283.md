Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1091 Pacu Pacu can create snapshots of EBS volumes and RDS instances.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Routinely check user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the capability to create
snapshots and backups.
M1018 User Account
ManagementLimit permissions for creating snapshots or backups in accordance with least privilege. Organizations
should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative
privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement
reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.An adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses. A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an
existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume. An adversary may leverage permissions to
create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in Revert Cloud
Instance where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.
An adversary may Create Cloud Instance, mount one or more created snapshots to that instance, and then apply a policy that allows the
adversary access to the created instance, such as a ﬁrewall policy that allows them inbound and outbound SSH access.Other sub-techniques of Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure (5)

ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0020 Snapshot Snapshot
CreationThe creation of a snapshot is a common part of operations within many cloud environments.
Events should then not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead
to other activities such as the creation of one or more snapshots and the restoration of these
snapshots by a new user account.In AWS, CloudTrail logs capture the creation of snapshots
and all API calls for AWS Backup as events. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you
can determine the request that was made, the IP address from which the request was made,
which user made the request, when it was made, and additional details.In Azure, the creation
of a snapshot may be captured in Azure activity logs. Backup restoration events can also be
detected through Azure Monitor Log Data by creating a custom alert for completed restore
jobs.Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the
usage of the gcloud compute instances create command to create a new VM disk from a
snapshot. It is also possible to detect the usage of the GCP API with
the sourceSnapshot  parameter pointed to global/snapshots/[BOOT\_SNAPSHOT\_NAME] .
Snapshot
MetadataPeriodically baseline snapshots to identify malicious modiﬁcations or additions.
