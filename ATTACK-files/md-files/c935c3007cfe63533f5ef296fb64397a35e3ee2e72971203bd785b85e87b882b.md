https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570/ 3/7Lateral Tool Transfer
Adversaries may transfer tools or other ﬁles between systems in a compromised environment. Once brought into the victim environment (i.e.,
Ingress Tool Transfer) ﬁles may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other ﬁles over the course of an
operation.
Adversaries may copy ﬁles between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent ﬁle sharing protocols such as ﬁle
sharing over SMB/Windows Admin Shares to connected network shares or with authenticated connections via Remote Desktop Protocol.
Files can also be transferred using native or otherwise present tools on the victim system, such as scp, rsync, curl, sftp, and ftp. In some
cases, adversaries may be able to leverage Web Services such as Dropbox or OneDrive to copy ﬁles from one machine to another via shared,
automatically synced folders.[1]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1037 Filter Network
TraﬃcConsider using the host ﬁrewall to restrict ﬁle sharing communications such as SMB. 
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware or unusual data transfer over known tools and protocols like FTP can be used to
mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be
based on the speciﬁc obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be
different across various malware families and versions. [27]

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions for abnormal usage of utilities
and command-line arguments that may be used in support of remote transfer of ﬁles
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor newly constructed ﬁles to/from a lateral tool transfer
File Metadata Monitor for alike ﬁle hashes or characteristics (ex: ﬁlename) that are created on multiple
hosts.
DS0023 Named Pipe Named Pipe
MetadataMonitor for contextual data about named pipes on the system.
DS0033 Network Share Network Share
AccessMonitor for unexpected network share access, such as ﬁles transferred between shares
within a network using protocols such as SMB.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor for unusual processes with internal network connections creating ﬁles on-system
may be suspicious
Note: Analytic Event Type is for Zeek but can also be implemented in other Network
Analysis Frameworks by parsing & decoding captured SMB2 network traﬃc. From a
network traﬃc capture standpoint, it’s important to capture the right traﬃc for this type of
detection to function (e.g., all endpoint to endpoint if possible or workstation to server
and workstation to workstation). As such, it is helpful to have a centralized server area
where it is possible to monitor communications between servers and endpoints.
Analytic 1 and 2 are very similar, with the key difference being that Implementation
2 is intended to capture multiple attempts at lateral movement originating from the
same host within a short time period (5 minutes).
Analytic 1 - Basic
suspicious\_smb\_traffic = filter log\_events where ((event\_id ==
"smb2\_write\_response" OR event\_id == "smb1\_write\_response" OR event\_id ==
"smb1\_write\_andx\_response") AND (connection.smb\_state.path == "ADMIN$" OR
connection.smb\_state.path == "C$") )
Analytic 2 - Multiple Attempts (Time Window)
suspicious\_smb\_traffic = filter log\_events where ((event\_id ==
"smb2\_write\_response" OR event\_id == "smb1\_write\_response" OR event\_id ==
"smb1\_write\_andx\_response") AND (connection.smb\_state.path == "ADMIN$" OR
connection.smb\_state.path == "C$") REPEATS 5 TIMES WITHIN 5 MINUTES FROM
SAME src\_ip)
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor for network traﬃc originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.
Local network traﬃc metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of
network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor newly constructed processes that assist in lateral tool transfers.3/22/24, 3:49 PM Lateral Tool Transfer, Technique T1570 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
