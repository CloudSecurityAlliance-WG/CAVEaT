https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217/ 3/5Browser Information Discovery
Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. Data saved by browsers (such as
bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites,
relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other
related infrastructure.
Browser information may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially Credentials In Files
associated with logins cached by a browser.
Speciﬁc storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser information is typically stored in local ﬁles and databases
(e.g., %APPDATA%/Google/Chrome ).[1]

ID Name Description
G0082 APT38 APT38 has collected browser bookmark information to learn more about compromised hosts, obtain
personal information about users, and acquire details about internal network resources.
S0274 Calisto Calisto collects information on bookmarks from Google Chrome.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has used type \\c$\Users\ \Favorites\Links\Bookmarks bar\Imported From IE\*citrix\*
for bookmark discovery.
S0673 DarkWatchman DarkWatchman can retrieve browser history.
S0567 Dtrack Dtrack can retrieve browser history.
S0363 Empire Empire has the ability to gather browser data such as bookmarks and visited sites.
G0117 Fox Kitten Fox Kitten has used Google Chrome bookmarks to identify internal resources and assets.
S0681 Lizar Lizar can retrieve browser history and database ﬁles.
S0409 Machete Machete retrieves the user proﬁle data (e.g., browsers) from Chrome and Firefox browsers.
S1060 Mafalda Mafalda can collect the contents of the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
Data\LocalState ﬁle.
S0079 MobileOrder MobileOrder has a command to upload to its C2 server victim browser bookmarks.

S1042 SUGARDUMP SUGARDUMP has collected browser bookmark and history information.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to gather
browser information, such as local ﬁles and databases (e.g., %APPDATA%/Google/Chrome ).
Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly using APIs to gather
information. Information may also be acquired through system management tools such as
Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for unusual access to stored browser data, such as local ﬁles and databases (e.g.,
%APPDATA%/Google/Chrome ). Rather than viewing these events in isolation, this activity
may highlight a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection and
Exﬁltration.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for processes with arguments that may be associated with gathering browser
information, such as local ﬁles and databases (e.g., %APPDATA%/Google/Chrome ).[3]
