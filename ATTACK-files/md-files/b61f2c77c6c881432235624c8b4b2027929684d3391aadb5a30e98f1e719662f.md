https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/ 3/15Windows Management Instrumentation
Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is an
administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components. The WMI service enables both local
and remote access, though the latter is facilitated by Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Windows
Remote Management (WinRM). Remote WMI over DCOM operates using port 135, whereas WMI over WinRM operates over port 5985 when
using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS.
An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering
information for Discovery as well as remote Execution of ﬁles as part of Lateral Movement. [1]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to block processes created by WMI
commands from running. Note: many legitimate tools and applications utilize WMI for command
execution. 
M1038 Execution
PreventionUse application control conﬁgured to block execution of wmic.exe if it is not required for a given
system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries. For example, in Windows 10 and
Windows Server 2016 and above, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy rules may be
applied to block the wmic.exe application and to prevent abuse.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementPrevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts. 
M1018 User Account
ManagementBy default, only administrators are allowed to connect remotely using WMI. Restrict other users who are
allowed to connect, or disallow all users to connect remotely to WMI.[132]

DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor network traﬃc for WMI connections for potential use to remotely edit
conﬁguration, start services, or query ﬁles. When remote WMI requests are over RPC it
connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC group netsvcs . To detect this activity, a
sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traﬃc or on the host where the
communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using
wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over
RPC can be detected. Although the description details how to detect remote WMI
precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC
connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-
related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be
detected between hosts. More about RPCSS at : rpcss\_dcom\_interfaces.html
After the WMI connection has been initialized, a process can be remotely launched using
the command: wmic /node:" " process call create " ", which is detected in the third
Detection Pseudocode.
This leaves artifacts at both a network (RPC) and process (command line) level. When
wmic.exe (or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC
(135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.
After RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through
which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented. With the right packet
decoders, or by looking for certain byte streams in raw data, these functions can be
identiﬁed.
When the command line is executed, it has the parent process
of C:\windows\system32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe . This analytic looks for these two events
happening in sequence, so that the network connection and target process are output.
Certain strings can be identiﬁers of the WMI by looking up the interface UUID for
IRemUnknown2 in different formats- UUID 00000143-0000-0000-c000-
000000000046  (decoded)- Hex 43 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 00 00 00 00 00 00
46 (raw)- ASCII CF (printable text only)
This identiﬁer is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has
access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement this analytic. The
transfer syntax is- UUID 8a885d04-1ceb-11c9-9fe8-08002b104860  (decoded)- Hex 04
5d 88 8a eb 1c c9 11 9f e8 08 00 2b 10 48 60  (raw)- ASCII `]+H`` (printable text
only)
Thus, a great ASCII based signature is- CF]+HCFCFhost"
Note: To detect WMI over RPC (using DCOM), a sensor needs to exist that has the insight
into individual connections and can actually decode and make sense of RPC traﬃc.
Speciﬁcally, WMI can be detected by looking at RPC traﬃc where the target interface
matches that of WMI, which is IRemUnknown2. Look for instances of the WMI querying in
network traﬃc, and ﬁnd the cases where a process is launched immediately after a
connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI
with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this
time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be
merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traﬃc to see if
the desired command can be extracted.

DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines of "wmic". If the
command line utility wmic.exe  is used on the source host, then it can additionally be
detected on an analytic. The command line on the source host is constructed into
something like wmic.exe /node:"\" process call create "\" . It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string "\
" would instead look like IP Address. Processes can be created remotely via
WMI in a few other ways, such as more direct API access or the built-in utility PowerShell.
Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process access) and Windows Security Log
(Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created).
Besides executing arbitrary processes, wmic.exe can also be used to executed data stored
in NTFS alternate data streams NTFS File Attributes.Looks for instances of wmic.exe as
well as the substrings in the command line:- process call create- /node:
