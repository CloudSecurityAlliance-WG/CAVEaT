https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/ 3/5Steal Web Session Cookie
An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as
an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after
a user has authenticated to a website.
Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the
process memory of the browser, and in network traﬃc to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store
sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some
multi-factor authentication protocols.
There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system. There are also open source
frameworks such as Evilginx2 and Muraena that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy (ex: Adversary-in-the-Middle) that
can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.
After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a Web Session Cookie technique to login to the corresponding web
application.[1]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationA physical second factor key that uses the target login domain as part of the negotiation protocol will
prevent session cookie theft through proxy methods.
M1054 Software
ConﬁgurationConﬁgure browsers or tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies.
M1017 User Training Train users to identify aspects of phishing attempts where they're asked to enter credentials into a
site that has the incorrect domain for the application they are logging into.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by
providing credentials to cloud service management consoles. Some cloud providers, such as
AWS, provide distinct log events for login attempts to the management console.
DS0009 Process Process
AccessMonitor for attempts by programs to inject into or dump browser process memory.[6]
