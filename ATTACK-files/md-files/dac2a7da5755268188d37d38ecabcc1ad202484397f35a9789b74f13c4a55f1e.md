Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0600 Doki Doki’s container was conﬁgured to bind the host root directory.
S0601 Hildegard Hildegard has used the BOtB tool that can break out of containers. 
S0683 Peirates Peirates can gain a reverse shell on a host node by mounting the Kubernetes hostPath.
S0623 Siloscape Siloscape maps the host’s C drive to the container by creating a global symbolic link to the host through the
calling of NtSetInformationSymbolicLink .
G0139 TeamTNT TeamTNT has deployed privileged containers that mount the ﬁlesystem of victim machine.Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host. This can allow an adversary access to other containerized
resources from the host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application
functionality and be isolated from the host environment.
There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment. Examples include creating a container conﬁgured to mount the
host’s ﬁlesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the
host; utilizing a privileged container to run commands or load a malicious kernel module on the underlying host; or abusing system calls
such as unshare and keyctl to escalate privileges and steal secrets.
Additionally, an adversary may be able to exploit a compromised container with a mounted container management socket, such as
docker.sock , to break out of the container via a Container Administration Command. Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for
Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.
Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence,
moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.[1]

ID Mitigation Description
M1048 Application Isolation
and SandboxingConsider utilizing seccomp, seccomp-bpf, or a similar solution that restricts certain system calls such
as mount. In Kubernetes environments, consider deﬁning Pod Security Standards that limit container
access to host process namespaces, the host network, and the host ﬁle system.
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramRemove unnecessary tools and software from containers.
M1038 Execution
PreventionUse read-only containers, read-only ﬁle systems, and minimal images when possible to prevent the
running of commands. Where possible, also consider using application control and software
restriction tools (such as those provided by SELinux) to restrict access to ﬁles, processes, and system
calls in containers.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementEnsure containers are not running as root by default and do not use unnecessary privileges or
mounted components. In Kubernetes environments, consider deﬁning Pod Security Standards that
prevent pods from running privileged containers.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0032 Container Container
CreationMonitor for the deployment of suspicious or unknown container images and pods in your
environment, particularly containers running as root.
DS0008 Kernel Kernel Module
LoadMonitor for the installation of kernel modules that could be abused to escape containers on
a host.
DS0009 Process OS API Execution Monitor for unexpected usage of syscalls such as mount  that may indicate an attempt to
escape from a privileged container to host.
Process Creation Monitor for process activity (such as unexpected processes spawning outside a container
and/or on a host) that might indicate an attempt to escape from a privileged container to
host.
DS0034 Volume Volume
ModiﬁcationMonitor cluster-level (Kubernetes) data and events associated with changing containers'
volume conﬁgurations.[14]
