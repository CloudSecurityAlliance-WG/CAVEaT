Environment Variable
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0363 Empire Empire contains modules that can discover and exploit path interception opportunities in the PATH
environment variable.
S0194 PowerSploit PowerSploit contains a collection of Privesc-PowerUp modules that can discover and exploit path interception
opportunities in the PATH environment variable.Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment
variable contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially through in search of the binary that was called
from a script or the command line.
Adversaries can place a malicious program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, resulting in
the operating system executing the malicious binary rather than the legitimate binary when it searches sequentially through that PATH
listing.
For example, on Windows if an adversary places a malicious program named "net.exe" in C:\example path , which by default precedes
C:\Windows\system32\net.exe in the PATH environment variable, when "net" is executed from the command-line the C:\example path
will be called instead of the system's legitimate executable at C:\Windows\system32\net.exe . Some methods of executing a program rely
on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched when the path for the program is not given, such as
executing programs from a Command and Scripting Interpreter.
Adversaries may also directly modify the $PATH variable specifying the directories to be searched. An adversary can modify the $PATH
variable to point to a directory they have write access. When a program using the $PATH variable is called, the OS searches the speciﬁed
directory and executes the malicious binary. On macOS, this can also be performed through modifying the $HOME variable. These variables
can be modiﬁed using the command-line, launchctl, Unix Shell Conﬁguration Modiﬁcation, or modifying the /etc/paths.d folder contents.Other sub-techniques of Hijack Execution Flow (12)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Find and eliminate path interception weaknesses in program conﬁguration ﬁles, scripts, the PATH
environment variable, services, and in shortcuts by surrounding PATH variables with quotation marks
when functions allow for them. Be aware of the search order Windows uses for executing or loading
binaries and use fully qualiﬁed paths wherever appropriate.
Clean up old Windows Registry keys when software is uninstalled to avoid keys with no associated
legitimate binaries. Periodically search for and correct or report path interception weaknesses on
systems that may have been introduced using custom or available tools that report software using
insecure path conﬁgurations.
M1038 Execution
PreventionAdversaries will likely need to place new binaries in locations to be executed through this weakness.
Identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application
control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies
where appropriate.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory
PermissionsEnsure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write
ﬁles to the top-level directory C: and system directories, such as C:\Windows\ , to reduce places where
malicious ﬁles could be placed for execution. Require that all executables be placed in write-protected
directories.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles for ﬁles named after partial directories and in
locations that may be searched for common processes through the environment
variable, or otherwise should not be user writable. Also, monitor ﬁle creation for
programs that are named after Windows system programs or programs commonly
executed without a path (such as "ﬁndstr," "net," and "python"). If this activity occurs
outside of known administration activity, upgrades, installations, or patches, then it
may be suspicious.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for newly executed processes for process executable paths that are named
for partial directories.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows
Registry Key
ModiﬁcationMonitor for modiﬁcations of PATH environment variable Registry keys such as
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
Manager\Environment\Path . An adversary can add a new directory or list of
directories before other locations where programs can be executed from.[8][9][10]
