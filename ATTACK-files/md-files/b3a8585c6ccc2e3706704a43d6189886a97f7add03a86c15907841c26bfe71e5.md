Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0085 FIN4 FIN4 has created rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing words such
as "hacked," "phish," and "malware" in a likely attempt to prevent organizations from communicating about their
activities.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Enterprise email solutions may have monitoring mechanisms that may include the ability to audit inbox rules on a
regular basis.
In an Exchange environment, Administrators can use Get-InboxRule / Remove-InboxRule and Get-
TransportRule / Remove-TransportRule to discover and remove potentially malicious inbox and transport
rules.Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox. Many email clients allow users to create inbox
rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails. Rules may be created
or modiﬁed within email clients or through external features such as the New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule PowerShell cmdlets on
Windows systems.
Adversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and/or move emails to less noticeable folders.
Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to Internal Spearphishing emails sent from the
compromised account.
Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) may be able to create rules to automatically move or
delete emails. These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender.
Malicious rules commonly ﬁlter out emails based on key words (such as malware , suspicious , phish , and hack ) found in message
bodies and subject lines. 
In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes.
For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-speciﬁed conditions,
then performs a user-speciﬁed action on mail that adheres to those conditions. Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to
automatically modify or delete all emails related to speciﬁc topics (such as internal security incident notiﬁcations).Other sub-techniques of Hide Artifacts (11)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox. Monitor email
clients and applications for suspicious activity, such as missing messages or abnormal
conﬁguration and/or log entries. In environments using Exchange, monitor logs for the
creation or modiﬁcation of mail transport rules.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionOn Windows and Exchange systems, monitor for creation or modiﬁcation of suspicious
inbox rules through the use of the New-InboxRule , Set-InboxRule , New-
TransportRule , and Set-TransportRule PowerShell cmdlets.
DS0022 File File
ModiﬁcationOn MacOS systems, monitor for modiﬁcations to the RulesActiveState.plist ,
SyncedRules.plist , UnsyncedRules.plist , and MessageRules.plist ﬁles.
