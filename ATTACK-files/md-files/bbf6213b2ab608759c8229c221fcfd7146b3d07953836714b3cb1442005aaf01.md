https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002/ 3/8Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography
Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traﬃc rather than relying on any
inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a
keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with
the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the
encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.
For eﬃciency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric
cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classiﬁed as Asymmetric Cryptography.Other sub-techniques of Encrypted Channel (2)
