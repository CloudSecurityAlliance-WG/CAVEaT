Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1021 Restrict Web-Based
ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of
unauthorized external services.Adversaries may exﬁltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel. Code repositories are often
accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level
of protection.
Exﬁltration to a code repository can also provide a signiﬁcant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by
hosts within the network.Other sub-techniques of Exﬁltration Over Web Service (4)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed command and arguments that may exﬁltrate data to a code repository
rather than over their primary command and control channel.
DS0022 File File Access Monitor for ﬁles being accessed to exﬁltrate data to a code repository rather than over
their primary command and control channel.
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor and analyze traﬃc patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that
do not follow the expected protocol standards and traﬃc ﬂows (e.g extraneous packets
that do not belong to established ﬂows, gratuitous or anomalous traﬃc patterns,
anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and
command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments
associated to traﬃc patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of ﬁles that do not normally
initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network that do
not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are
suspicious. Monitor for use of code repositories for data exﬁltration.
