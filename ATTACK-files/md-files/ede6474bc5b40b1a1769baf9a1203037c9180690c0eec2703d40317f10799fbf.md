Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide conﬁguration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up,
or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.
Access to speciﬁc areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-
line utility Reg may be used for local or remote Registry modiﬁcation. Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may
contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API.
Registry modiﬁcations may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be
ignored when read via Reg or other utilities using the Win32 API. Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands
used to maintain persistence. 
The Registry of a remote system may be modiﬁed to aid in execution of ﬁles as part of lateral movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be
running on the target system. Often Valid Accounts are required, along with access to the remote system's SMB/Windows Admin Shares for RPC
communication.[1]

ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to change, conceal,
and/or delete information in the Registry. The Registry may also be modiﬁed through Windows
system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell, which
may require additional logging features to be conﬁgured in the operating system to collect necessary
information for analysis.
DS0029 Network Traﬃc Network
Traﬃc FlowRemote access to the registry can be achieved via
Windows API function RegConnectRegistry
command line via reg.exe
graphically via regedit.exe
All of these behaviors call into the Windows API, which uses the NamedPipe WINREG over SMB to
handle the protocol information. This network can be decoded with wireshark or a similar sensor, and
can also be detected by hooking the API function.
Analytic 1 - Remote Registry

DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with concealing Registry keys, such as Reghide. Inspect and
cleanup malicious hidden Registry entries using Native Windows API calls and/or tools such as

RegOpenKeyExA , RegCreateKeyExA , RegDeleteKeyExA , RegDeleteValueExA , RegEnumKeyExA ,
RegEnumValueExA , among others.
Note: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls
produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API
calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including
OS API calls, for a single PE binary.[2]

Process
CreationMonitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to change, conceal,
and/or delete information in the Registry. (i.e. reg.exe, regedit.exe). The analytic is oriented around
detecting invocations of Reg where the parent executable is an instance of cmd.exe that wasn’t
spawned by explorer.exe. The built-in utility reg.exe provides a command-line interface to the registry,
so that queries and modiﬁcations can be performed from a shell, such as cmd.exe. When a user is
responsible for these actions, the parent of cmd.exewill typically be explorer.exe. Occasionally, power
users and administrators write scripts that do this behavior as well, but likely from a different process
tree. These background scripts must be baselined so they can be tuned out accordingly. Analytic
Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a
new process has been created).
Analytic 1 - Suspicious Processes

CreationMonitor for newly constructed registry keys or values to aid in persistence and execution. Detection of
creation of registry key HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
Manager\SafeDllSearchMode. The key SafeDllSearchMode, if set to 0, will block the Windows
mechanism for the search DLL order and adversaries may execute their own malicious dll.

Registry Key
DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of windows registry keys to hide conﬁguration information, remove
information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.
Windows
Registry Key
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to windows registry keys or values. Consider enabling Registry Auditing on
speciﬁc keys to produce an alertable event (Event ID 4657) whenever a value is changed (though this
may not trigger when values are created with Reghide or other evasive methods). Changes to
Registry entries that load software on Windows startup that do not correlate with known software,
patch cycles, etc., are suspicious, as are additions or changes to ﬁles within the startup folder.
Changes could also include new services and modiﬁcation of existing binary paths to point to
malicious ﬁles. If a change to a service-related entry occurs, then it will likely be followed by a local or
remote service start or restart to execute the ﬁle.
Detection of modiﬁcation of the registry key values of Notify, Userinit, and Shell located
in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ and HKEY\_LOCAL\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon. When a user logs on, the Registry key values
of Notify, Userinit and Shell are used to load dedicated Windows component. Attackers may insert
malicious payload following the legitimate value to launch a malicious payload.
Detection of the modiﬁcation of the registry key Common Startup located
in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell
Folders\ and HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User
Shell Folders. When a user logs on, any ﬁles located in the Startup Folder are launched. Attackers may
modify these folders with other ﬁles in order to evade detection set on these default folders. This
detection focuses on EventIDs 4688 and 1 for process creation and EventID 4657 for the modiﬁcation
of the Registry Keys.
