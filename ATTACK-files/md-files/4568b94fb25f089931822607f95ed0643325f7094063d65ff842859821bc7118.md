Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should be focused on initial access
activities, such as drive by compromise where ad blocking adblockers can help prevent malicious code from
executing.Adversaries may purchase online advertisements that can be abused to distribute malware to victims. Ads can be purchased to plant as well
as favorably position artifacts in speciﬁc locations online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. These ads may make it
more diﬃcult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements. Purchased ads may also target speciﬁc
audiences using the advertising network’s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines
and popular websites.
Adversaries may purchase ads and other resources to help distribute artifacts containing malicious code to victims. Purchased ads may
attempt to impersonate or spoof well-known brands. For example, these spoofed ads may trick victims into clicking the ad which could then
send them to a malicious domain that may be a clone of oﬃcial websites containing trojanized versions of the advertised software.
Adversary’s efforts to create malicious domains and purchase advertisements may also be automated at scale to better resist cleanup
efforts.
Malvertising may be used to support Drive-by Target and Drive-by Compromise, potentially requiring limited interaction from the user if the
ad contains code/exploits that infect the target system's web browser.
Adversaries may also employ several techniques to evade detection by the advertising network. For example, adversaries may dynamically
route ad clicks to send automated crawler/policy enforcer traﬃc to benign sites while validating potential targets then sending victims
referred from real ad clicks to malicious pages. This infection vector may therefore remain hidden from the ad network as well as any visitor
not reaching the malicious sites with a valid identiﬁer from clicking on the advertisement. Other tricks, such as intentional typos to avoid
brand reputation monitoring, may also be used to evade automated detection.Other sub-techniques of Acquire Infrastructure (8)

DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in the malicious web content related to malvertising have been
previously identiﬁed, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged
malicious web content. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the
target organization, making detection of this behavior diﬃcult. Detection efforts may be
focused on other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as Drive-by Compromise or
Exploitation for Client Execution.
