Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0534 Bazar Bazar's loader can delete scheduled tasks created by a previous instance of the malware.
S0632 GrimAgent GrimAgent can delete previously created tasks on a compromised host.
S0669 KOCTOPUS KOCTOPUS can delete created registry keys used for persistence as part of its cleanup procedure.
S0500 MCMD MCMD has the ability to remove set Registry Keys, including those used for persistence.
S0083 Misdat Misdat is capable of deleting Registry keys used for persistence.
S0385 njRAT njRAT is capable of manipulating and deleting registry keys, including those used for persistence.
S0517 Pillowmint Pillowmint can uninstall the malicious service from an infected machine.
S0148 RTM RTM has the ability to remove Registry entries that it created for persistence.
S0085 S-Type S-Type has deleted accounts it has created.
S0559 SUNBURST SUNBURST removed IFEO registry values to clean up traces of persistence.Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity.
This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, Modify Registry, Plist File Modiﬁcation, or other methods
of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence. Adversaries may also delete accounts previously
created to maintain persistence (i.e. Create Account).
In some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary’s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with
the new instance of the malware.Other sub-techniques of Indicator Removal (9)

ID Mitigation Description
M1029 Remote Data Storage Automatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the
adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system. When possible, minimize time delay
on event reporting to avoid prolonged storage on the local system.
M1022 Restrict File and
Directory
PermissionsProtect generated event ﬁles that are stored locally with proper permissions and authentication and
limit opportunities for adversaries to increase privileges by preventing Privilege Escalation
opportunities.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may delete or alter generated
artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.
DS0022 File File Deletion Monitor for a ﬁle that may delete or alter generated artifacts associated with
persistence on a host system.
File Modiﬁcation Monitor for changes made to a ﬁle may delete or alter generated artifacts
associated with persistence on a host system.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for newly executed processes that may delete or alter generated artifacts
associated with persistence on a host system.
DS0003 Scheduled Job Scheduled Job
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to scheduled jobs that may attempt to remove
artifacts on a host system.
DS0002 User Account User Account
DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may
highlight activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account
(e.g., Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted ).
Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so
compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and
correlate account modiﬁcation events with other indications of malicious activity
where possible.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key DeletionMonitor windows registry keys that may be deleted or alter generated artifacts
associated with persistence on a host system.
Windows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to windows registry keys or values that may delete or
alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.3/22/24, 3:43 PM Indicator Removal: Clear Persistence, Sub-technique T1070.009 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
