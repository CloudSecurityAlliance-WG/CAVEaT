Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1042 Disable or Remove
Feature or ProgramConsider removing mavinject.exe if Microsoft App-V is not used within a given environment.
M1038 Execution Prevention Use application control conﬁgured to block execution of mavinject.exe if it is not required for a
given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionAdversaries may rename abusable binaries to evade detections, but the argument
INJECTRUNNING is required for mavinject.exe to perform Dynamic-link Library Injection and
may therefore be monitored to alert malicious activity.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor the execution and arguments of mavinject.exe. Compare recent invocations of
mavinject.exe with prior history of known good arguments and injected DLLs to determine
anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.Adversaries may abuse mavinject.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Mavinject.exe is the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector,
a Windows utility that can inject code into external processes as part of Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V).
Adversaries may abuse mavinject.exe to inject malicious DLLs into running processes (i.e. Dynamic-link Library Injection), allowing for
arbitrary code execution (ex. C:\Windows\system32\mavinject.exe PID /INJECTRUNNING PATH\_DLL ). Since mavinject.exe may be
digitally signed by Microsoft, proxying execution via this method may evade detection by security products because the execution is masked
under a legitimate process.
In addition to Dynamic-link Library Injection, Mavinject.exe can also be abused to perform import descriptor injection via its /HMODULE
command-line parameter (ex. mavinject.exe PID /HMODULE=BASE\_ADDRESS PATH\_DLL ORDINAL\_NUMBER ). This command would inject an
import table entry consisting of the speciﬁed DLL into the module at the given base address.Other sub-techniques of System Binary Proxy Execution (13)
