https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104/ 3/5Multi-Stage Channels
Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Use
of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more diﬃcult.
Remote access tools will call back to the ﬁrst-stage command and control server for instructions. The ﬁrst stage may have automated
capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional ﬁles. A second remote access tool (RAT) could be
uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server. The second stage will likely be more fully
featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.
The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. The loader may also have backup ﬁrst-stage
callbacks or Fallback Channels in case the original ﬁrst-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.

ID Name Description
G0022 APT3 An APT3 downloader ﬁrst establishes a SOCKS5 connection to 192.157.198[.]103 using TCP port 1913;
once the server response is veriﬁed, it then requests a connection to 192.184.60[.]229 on TCP port 81.
G0096 APT41 APT41 used the storescyncsvc.dll BEACON backdoor to download a secondary backdoor.
S0031 BACKSPACE BACKSPACE attempts to avoid detection by checking a ﬁrst stage command and control server to determine
if it should connect to the second stage server, which performs "louder" interactions with the malware.
S0534 Bazar The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the Bazar backdoor.
S0069 BLACKCOFFEE BLACKCOFFEE uses Microsoft’s TechNet Web portal to obtain an encoded tag containing the IP address of
a command and control server and then communicates separately with that IP address for C2. If the C2
server is discovered or shut down, the threat actors can update the encoded IP address on TechNet to
maintain control of the victims’ machines.
S0220 Chaos After initial compromise, Chaos will download a second stage to establish a more permanent presence on
the affected system.
G0032 Lazarus Group Lazarus Group has used multi-stage malware components that inject later stages into separate processes.
G0069 MuddyWater MuddyWater has used one C2 to obtain enumeration scripts and monitor web logs, but a different C2 to
send data back.
S1086 Snip3 Snip3 can download and execute additional payloads and modules over separate communication
channels.
S0022 Uroburos Individual Uroburos implants can use multiple communication channels based on one of four available
modes of operation.
S0476 Valak Valak can download additional modules and malware capable of using separate C2 channels.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for
speciﬁc adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by
untrusted hosts.
Network Traﬃc Flow Monitor network data for uncommon data ﬂows. Processes utilizing the network
that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before
are suspicious.[1]
