https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/ 3/8Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to DLL Search Order Hijacking, side-loading involves
hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim
application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes
their payload(s).
Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious
payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted,
and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be ﬂagged during delivery
and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted
process.Other sub-techniques of Hijack Execution Flow (12)
