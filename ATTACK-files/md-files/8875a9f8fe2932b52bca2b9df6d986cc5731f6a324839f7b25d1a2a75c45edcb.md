https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004/ 3/8Application Layer Protocol: DNS
Adversaries may communicate using the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network ﬁltering by
blending in with existing traﬃc. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the
protocol traﬃc between the client and server.
The DNS protocol serves an administrative function in computer networking and thus may be very common in environments. DNS traﬃc
may also be allowed even before network authentication is completed. DNS packets contain many ﬁelds and headers in which data can be
concealed. Often known as DNS tunneling, adversaries may abuse DNS to communicate with systems under their control within a victim
network while also mimicking normal, expected traﬃc.Other sub-techniques of Application Layer Protocol (4)
