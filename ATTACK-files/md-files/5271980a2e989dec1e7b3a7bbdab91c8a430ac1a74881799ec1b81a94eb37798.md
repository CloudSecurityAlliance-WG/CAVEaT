Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0404 esentutl esentutl can use the Volume Shadow Copy service to copy locked ﬁles such as ntds.dit .
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior Prevention
on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be conﬁgured to block some types of behaviors related to
efforts by an adversary to create backups, such as command execution or preventing API calls to
backup related services.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnsure only accounts required to conﬁgure and manage backups have the privileges to do so.
Monitor these accounts for unauthorized backup activity.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that could be taken to copy ﬁles from the
logical drive and evade common ﬁle system protections. Since this technique may also be
used through PowerShell, additional logging of PowerShell scripts is recommended.
DS0016 Drive Drive Access Monitor handle opens on volumes that are made by processes to determine when they may
be directly collecting data from logical drives. 
DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for the creation of volume shadow copy and backup ﬁles, especially unexpected and
irregular activity (relative to time, user, etc.).Adversaries may directly access a volume to bypass ﬁle access controls and ﬁle system monitoring. Windows allows programs to have
direct access to logical volumes. Programs with direct access may read and write ﬁles directly from the drive by analyzing ﬁle system data
structures. This technique may bypass Windows ﬁle access controls as well as ﬁle system monitoring tools. 
Utilities, such as NinjaCopy , exist to perform these actions in PowerShell. Adversaries may also use built-in or third-party utilities (such as
vssadmin , wbadmin , and esentutl) to create shadow copies or backups of data from system volumes.[1]
