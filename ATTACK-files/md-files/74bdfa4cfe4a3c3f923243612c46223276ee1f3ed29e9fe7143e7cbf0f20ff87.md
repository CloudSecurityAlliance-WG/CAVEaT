https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004/ 3/6Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts
Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or
Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and conﬁgured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for
administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud or be hybrid
joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory. 
Service or user accounts may be targeted by adversaries through Brute Force, Phishing, or various other means to gain access to the
environment. Federated accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems and cloud environments.
An adversary may create long lasting Additional Cloud Credentials on a compromised cloud account to maintain persistence in the
environment. Such credentials may also be used to bypass security controls such as multi-factor authentication.
Cloud accounts may also be able to assume Temporary Elevated Cloud Access or other privileges through various means within the
environment. Misconﬁgurations in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to use these mechanisms to
leverage permissions outside the intended scope of the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive data from
online storage accounts and databases through Cloud API or other methods.Other sub-techniques of Valid Accounts (4)

ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 has used compromised Oﬃce 365 service accounts with Global Administrator privileges to
collect email from user inboxes.
G0016 APT29 APT29 has gained access to a global administrator account in Azure AD and has used Service
Principal credentials in Exchange.
G0064 APT33 APT33 has used compromised Oﬃce 365 accounts in tandem with Ruler in an attempt to gain
control of endpoints.
C0027 C0027 During C0027, Scattered Spider leveraged compromised credentials from victim users to authenticate
to Azure tenants.
G0004 Ke3chang Ke3chang has used compromised credentials to sign into victims’ Microsoft 365 accounts.
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has used compromised credentials to access cloud assets within a target organization.
S1091 Pacu Pacu leverages valid cloud accounts to perform most of its operations.
S0683 Peirates Peirates can use stolen service account tokens to perform its operations.
S0684 ROADTools ROADTools leverages valid cloud credentials to perform enumeration operations using the internal
Azure AD Graph API.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used a compromised O365 administrator account to
create a new Service Principal.[4]

ID Mitigation Description
M1036 Account Use
PoliciesUse conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside deﬁned
organization IP ranges.
M1015 Active Directory
ConﬁgurationDisable legacy authentication, which does not support MFA, and require the use of modern
authentication protocols instead.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for cloud accounts, especially privileged accounts. This can be
implemented in a variety of forms (e.g. hardware, virtual, SMS), and can also be audited using
administrative reporting features.
M1027 Password
PoliciesEnsure that cloud accounts, particularly privileged accounts, have complex, unique passwords across all
systems on the network. Passwords and access keys should be rotated regularly. This limits the amount
of time credentials can be used to access resources if a credential is compromised without your
knowledge. Cloud service providers may track access key age to help audit and identify keys that may
need to be rotated.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementReview privileged cloud account permission levels routinely to look for those that could allow an
adversary to gain wide access, such as Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator in Azure
AD. These reviews should also check if new privileged cloud accounts have been created that
were not authorized. For example, in Azure AD environments conﬁgure alerts to notify when accounts
have gone many days without using privileged roles, as these roles may be able to be removed.
Consider using temporary, just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to Azure AD resources rather than
permanently assigning privileged roles.
M1018 User Account
ManagementPeriodically review user accounts and remove those that are inactive or unnecessary. Limit the ability for
user accounts to create additional accounts.
M1017 User Training Applications may send push notiﬁcations to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Train users to only accept valid push notiﬁcations and to report suspicious push notiﬁcations.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for suspicious account behavior across cloud services that share account.
Logon Session
MetadataCorrelate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login
session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationMonitor the activity of cloud accounts to detect abnormal or malicious behavior, such as
accessing information outside of the normal function of the account, account usage at
atypical hours, or account authentication from unexpected locations or IP addresses.
Service accounts should only be accessible from IP addresses from within the cloud
environment. For example, in Azure AD environments, consider using Identity
Protection to ﬂag risky sign-ins based on location, device compliance, and other factors.[15]
