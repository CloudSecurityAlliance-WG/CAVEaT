Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S1091 Pacu Pacu can disable or otherwise restrict various AWS logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and VPC ﬂow logs.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1018 User Account
ManagementConﬁgure default account policy to enable logging. Manage policies to ensure only necessary users
have permissions to make changes to logging policies.An adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid
detection. Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user
does within the environment. If an adversary has suﬃcient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their
activities.
For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity. They
may alternatively tamper with logging functionality – for example, by removing any associated SNS topics, disabling multi-region logging, or
disabling settings that validate and/or encrypt log ﬁles. In Oﬃce 365, an adversary may disable logging on mail collection activities for
speciﬁc users by using the Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation cmdlet, by disabling M365 Advanced Auditing for the user, or by
downgrading the user’s license from an Enterprise E5 to an Enterprise E3 license.Other sub-techniques of Impair Defenses (11)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0025 Cloud ServiceCloud Service
DisableMonitor logs for API calls to disable logging. In AWS, monitor for: StopLogging ,
UpdateTrail DeleteTrail . In GCP, monitor for:
google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.UpdateSink and
google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.DeleteSink . In Azure, monitor for az monitor
diagnostic-settings update and az monitor diagnostic-settings delete .
Additionally, a sudden loss of a log source may indicate that it has been disabled.
Cloud Service
ModiﬁcationMonitor changes made to cloud services for unexpected modiﬁcations to settings and/or
data
DS0002 User AccountUser Account
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes to account settings associated with users/tenants that may impact
defensive logging capabilities, such as the Update User and Change User License
events in the Azure AD audit log.
