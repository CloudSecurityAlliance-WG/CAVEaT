https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002/ 3/6Dynamic Resolution: Domain Generation Algorithms
Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control
traﬃc rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to
block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for
instructions.
DGAs can take the form of apparently random or "gibberish" strings (ex: istgmxdejdnxuyla.ru) when they construct domain names by
generating each letter. Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters (ex:
cityjulydish.net). Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period (hourly, daily, monthly, etc). Others
incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more diﬃcult for defenders.
Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of Fallback Channels. When contact is lost with the primary command and control server
malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.Other sub-techniques of Dynamic Resolution (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1031 Network
Intrusion
PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traﬃc for speciﬁc
adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Malware researchers can reverse
engineer malware variants that use DGAs and determine future domains that the malware will attempt to
contact, but this is a time and resource intensive effort. Malware is also increasingly incorporating seed
values that can be unique for each instance, which would then need to be determined to extract future
generated domains. In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traﬃc.
 Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for
defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost.

ContentIn some cases a local DNS sinkhole may be used to help prevent DGA-based command and control at a
reduced cost.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Traﬃc FlowDetecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of
different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing
complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-
randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains,
entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. 
CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In
addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach
for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely
visited domains.Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been
developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram
methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the
randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be
determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA. Another approach is to
use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated][1][32]
