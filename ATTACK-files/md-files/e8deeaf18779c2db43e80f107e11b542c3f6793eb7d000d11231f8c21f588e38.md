https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/ 3/10Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol
Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to log into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The adversary may then perform
actions as the logged-on user.
Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop
graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote
Desktop Services (RDS).
Adversaries may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with
known credentials. Adversaries will likely use Credential Access techniques to acquire credentials to use with RDP. Adversaries may also use
RDP in conjunction with the Accessibility Features or Terminal Services DLL for Persistence.Other sub-techniques of Remote Services (8)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for user accounts logged into systems associated with RDP (ex: Windows EID
4624 Logon Type 10). Other factors, such as access patterns (ex: multiple systems over
a relatively short period of time) and activity that occurs after a remote login, may
indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with RDP.
Monitoring logon and logoff events for hosts on the network is very important for
situational awareness. This information can be used as an indicator of unusual activity
as well as to corroborate activity seen elsewhere.
Could be applied to a number of different types of monitoring depending on what
information is desired. Some use cases include monitoring for all remote connections
and building login timelines for users. Logon events are Windows Event Code 4624 for
Windows Vista and above, 518 for pre-Vista. Logoff events are 4634 for Windows Vista
and above, 538 for pre-Vista.
Analytic
filtered\_logons = filter logon\_events where ( (event\_id = "4624") AND user
NOT IN TOP30(user))
Logon Session
MetadataMonitor authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns. A remote desktop
logon, through RDP, may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only
from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to
known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.
Analytic
suspicious\_logon = filter logons where (event\_id = "4624" AND
AuthenticationPackageName = 'Negotiate' AND Severity = "Information" AND
logon\_type = "10")
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork
Connection
CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections (typically over port 3389) that may
use Valid Accounts to log into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user. Other factors, such as
access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or
malicious behavior with RDP.
Network Traﬃc
FlowMonitor network traﬃc for uncommon data ﬂows that may use Valid Accounts to log
into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), built in to Microsoft operating systems, allows a
user to remotely log in to the desktop of another host. It allows for interactive access of
the running windows, and forwards key presses, mouse clicks, etc. Network
administrators, power users, and end-users may use RDP for day-to-day operations.
From an adversary’s perspective, RDP provides a means to laterally move to a new host.
Determining which RDP connections correspond to adversary activity can be a diﬃcult
problem in highly dynamic environments, but will be useful in identifying the scope of a
compromise.Remote Desktop can be detected in several ways
Network connections to port 3389/tcp (assuming use of the default port)
Packet capture analysis
Windows security logs (Event ID 4624, 4634, 4647, 4778)
Detecting network connections from mstsc.exe
Execution of the process rdpclip.exe
Runs as the clipboard manager on the RDP target if clipboard sharing is enabled
