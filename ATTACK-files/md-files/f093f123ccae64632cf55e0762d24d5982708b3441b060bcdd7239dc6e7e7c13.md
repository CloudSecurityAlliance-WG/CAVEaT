https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/ 3/18Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and
scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions,
including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an
executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are
required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).
PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without
touching disk.
A number of PowerShell-based offensive testing tools are available, including Empire, PowerSploit, PoshC2, and PSAttack.
PowerShell commands/scripts can also be executed without directly invoking the powershell.exe binary through interfaces to
PowerShell's underlying System.Management.Automation assembly DLL exposed through the .NET framework and Windows Common
Language Interface (CLI).Other sub-techniques of Command and Scripting Interpreter (9)

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware Anti-virus can be used to automatically quarantine suspicious ﬁles.
M1045 Code Signing Set PowerShell execution policy to execute only signed scripts.
M1042 Disable or Remove Feature
or ProgramIt may be possible to remove PowerShell from systems when not needed, but a review should
be performed to assess the impact to an environment, since it could be in use for many
legitimate purposes and administrative functions.
Disable/restrict the WinRM Service to help prevent uses of PowerShell for remote execution.
M1038 Execution Prevention Use application control where appropriate. PowerShell Constrained Language mode can be
used to restrict access to sensitive or otherwise dangerous language elements such as those
used to execute arbitrary Windows APIs or ﬁles (e.g., Add-Type ).
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementWhen PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting PowerShell execution policy to
administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy,
depending on environment conﬁguration.
PowerShell JEA (Just Enough Administration) may also be used to sandbox administration
and limit what commands admins/users can execute through remote PowerShell sessions.[264]

ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionIf proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to deﬁne their own execution
policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the
command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of
PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell
execution may detect malicious activity. It is also beneﬁcial to turn on PowerShell logging to
gain increased ﬁdelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations).
 PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features
have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many
logging features. An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data
analytic platform to supplement it with other data.
DS0011 Module Module Load Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell speciﬁc
assemblies, such as System.Management.Automation.dll (especially to unusual process
names/locations).
Analytic 1 - Processes loading PowerShell assemblies
suspicious\_processes = filter ProcessGuid, ProcessFilePath, ModulePath,
FileDescription where EventId == "7" AND (ModulePath LIKE
'%system.management.automation%' OR FileDescription LIKE
'%system.management.automation%')
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for
execution.
Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process access) and Windows Security Log
(Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). - The logic for Analytic 1 is based around
detecting on non-interactive Powershell sessions (i.e., those not launched by a user through
explorer.exe). This may lead to false positives when used in a production environment, so we
recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., looking for
suspicious parent processes) that helps ﬁlter such events.- The logic for Analytic 2 is based
around detecting on remote Powershell sessions. PowerShell can be used over WinRM to
remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe
executes wsmprovhost.exe.
Analytic 1- Non-interactive Powershell Sessions
processes = filter process where ((event\_id="10" OR event\_id="4688") AND exe ==
"powershell.exe" AND parent\_exe != "explorer.exe")
Analytic 2- Remote Powershell Sessions
processes = filter process where ((event\_id="10" OR event\_id="4688") AND exe ==
"wsmprovhost.exe" and parent\_exe == "svchost.exe")
Process
MetadataConsider monitoring for Windows event ID (EID) 400, which shows the version of PowerShell
executing in the EngineVersion ﬁeld (which may also be relevant to detecting a potential
Downgrade Attack) as well as if PowerShell is running locally or remotely in the HostName
ﬁeld. Furthermore, EID 400 may indicate the start time and EID 403 indicates the end time of a
PowerShell session.
DS0012 Script Script
ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered
suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of
cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be
captured from the ﬁle system when possible to determine their actions and intent.[267]
