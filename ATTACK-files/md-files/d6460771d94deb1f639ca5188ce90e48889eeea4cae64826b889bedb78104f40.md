https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003/ 3/5Obfuscated Files or Information: Steganography
Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. Steganographic techniques can be
used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text ﬁles.
Duqu was an early example of malware that used steganography. It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it
within an image before exﬁltrating the image to a C2 server.
By the end of 2017, a threat group used Invoke-PSImage to hide PowerShell commands in an image ﬁle (.png) and execute the code on a
victim's system. In this particular case the PowerShell code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's
machine and communicate it back to the adversary.Other sub-techniques of Obfuscated Files or Information (12)

Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data SourceData ComponentDetects
DS0022 File File Metadata Detection of steganography is diﬃcult unless artifacts are left behind by the obfuscation
process that are detectable with a known signature. Look for strings or other signatures left in
system artifacts related to decoding steganography.
