https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/ 3/6Brute Force
Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are
obtained. Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using
a repetitive or iterative mechanism. Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those
credentials or oﬄine against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.
Brute forcing credentials may take place at various points during a breach. For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access to
Valid Accounts within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as OS Credential
Dumping, Account Discovery, or Password Policy Discovery. Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as
External Remote Services as part of Initial Access.Sub-techniques (4)

ID Name Description
C0025 2016 Ukraine Electric
Power AttackDuring the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team used a script to attempt RPC
authentication against a number of hosts.
G0007 APT28 APT28 can perform brute force attacks to obtain credentials.
G0082 APT38 APT38 has used brute force techniques to attempt account access when passwords are
unknown or when password hashes are unavailable.
G0087 APT39 APT39 has used Ncrack to reveal credentials.
S0572 Caterpillar WebShell Caterpillar WebShell has a module to perform brute force attacks on a system.
S0220 Chaos Chaos conducts brute force attacks against SSH services to gain initial access.

ID Mitigation Description
M1036 Account Use
PoliciesSet account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from
being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-
usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to
block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside deﬁned organization IP ranges.
M1032 Multi-factor
AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally
facing services.
M1027 Password
PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.
M1018 User Account
ManagementProactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after
detecting bruteforce attempts.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of Valid
Accounts. If authentication failures are high, then there may be a brute force attempt
to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may use brute force techniques to
gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes
are obtained.
DS0002 User Account User Account
AuthenticationMonitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may
result from password spraying attempts. It is diﬃcult to detect when hashes are
cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.[25]
