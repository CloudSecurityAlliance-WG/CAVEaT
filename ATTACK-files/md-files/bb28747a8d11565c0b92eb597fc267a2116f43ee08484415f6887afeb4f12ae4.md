Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0007 APT28 APT28 has collected information from Microsoft SharePoint services within target networks.
C0027 C0027 During C0027, Scattered Spider accessed victim SharePoint environments to search for VPN and MFA
enrollment information, help desk instructions, and new hire guides.
G0114 Chimera Chimera has collected documents from the victim's SharePoint.
G0004 Ke3chang Ke3chang used a SharePoint enumeration and data dumping tool known as spwebmember.
G1004 LAPSUS$ LAPSUS$ has searched a victim's network for collaboration platforms like SharePoint to discover further
high-privilege account credentials.
S0227 spwebmember spwebmember is used to enumerate and dump information from Microsoft SharePoint.Adversaries may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information. SharePoint will often contain useful
information for an adversary to learn about the structure and functionality of the internal network and systems. For example, the following is
a list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on SharePoint:
Policies, procedures, and standards
Physical / logical network diagrams
System architecture diagrams
Technical system documentation
Testing / development credentials
Work / project schedules
Source code snippets
Links to network shares and other internal resourcesOther sub-techniques of Data from Information Repositories (3)

ID Mitigation Description
M1047 Audit Consider periodic review of accounts and privileges for critical and sensitive SharePoint
repositories.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnforce the principle of least-privilege. Consider implementing access control mechanisms that
include both authentication and authorization.
M1017 User Training Develop and publish policies that deﬁne acceptable information to be stored in SharePoint
repositories.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application
Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may
leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information. Monitor
access to Microsoft SharePoint repositories performed by privileged users (for example,
Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely
monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to
access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and
alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages;
this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data
within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage
User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.
DS0028 Logon Session Logon Session
CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across Microsoft's SharePoint which can
be conﬁgured to report access to certain pages and documents. As information
repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use
can be non-trivial.
