https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202/ 3/4Indirect Command Execution
Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0193 Forﬁles Forﬁles can be used to subvert controls and possibly conceal command execution by not directly invoking
cmd.
G0032 Lazarus
GroupLazarus Group persistence mechanisms have used forfiles.exe to execute .htm ﬁles.
S0379 Revenge RAT Revenge RAT uses the Forﬁles utility to execute commands on the system.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments to bypass security restrictions that limit the
use of command-line interpreters.
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that can be used instead of
invoking cmd (i.e. pcalua.exe, winrs.exe, cscript/wscript.exe, hh.exe, or bash.exe)Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line
interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking cmd. For example, Forﬁles, the
Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke
the execution of programs and commands from a Command and Scripting Interpreter, Run window, or via scripts. 
Adversaries may abuse these features for Defense Evasion, speciﬁcally to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or
mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of cmd or ﬁle extensions more commonly associated with malicious
payloads.[1][2]
