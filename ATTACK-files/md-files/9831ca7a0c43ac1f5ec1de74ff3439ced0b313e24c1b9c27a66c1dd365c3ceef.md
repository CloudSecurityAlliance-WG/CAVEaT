Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0012 PoisonIvy PoisonIvy creates a Registry key in the Active Setup pointing to a malicious executable.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows
mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into
the computer. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.
Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\ and
setting a malicious value for StubPath . This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.
Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.
Adversaries may also use Masquerading to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.Other sub-techniques of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (14)
