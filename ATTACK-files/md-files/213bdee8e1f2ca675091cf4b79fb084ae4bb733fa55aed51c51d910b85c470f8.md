Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0022 APT3 APT3 has a tool that can enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups.
S0335 Carbon Carbon uses the net group command.
G1016 FIN13 FIN13 has enumerated all users and roles from a victim's main treasury system.
S0483 IcedID IcedID has the ability to identify Workgroup membership.
S0233 MURKYTOP MURKYTOP has the capability to retrieve information about groups.
S0445 ShimRatReporter ShimRatReporter gathered the local privileges for the infected host.
S0623 Siloscape Siloscape checks for Kubernetes node permissions.
C0024 SolarWinds
CompromiseDuring the SolarWinds Compromise, APT29 used the Get-ManagementRoleAssignment PowerShell
cmdlet to enumerate Exchange management role assignments through an Exchange Management
Shell.
G0092 TA505 TA505 has used TinyMet to enumerate members of privileged groups. TA505 has also run net
group /domain .
S0266 TrickBot TrickBot can identify the groups the user on a compromised host belongs to.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.Adversaries may attempt to discover group and permission settings. This information can help adversaries determine which user accounts
and groups are available, the membership of users in particular groups, and which users and groups have elevated permissions.
Adversaries may attempt to discover group permission settings in many different ways. This data may provide the adversary with
information about the compromised environment that can be used in follow-on activity and targeting.Sub-techniques (3)

ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0015 Application Log Application Log
ContentMonitor for logging, messaging, and other artifacts provided by cloud services.
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments acquired through Windows system
management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.
DS0036 Group Group
EnumerationMonitor for an extracted list of ACLs of available groups and/or their associated
settings.
Group
MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a group which describes group and activity around it.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines for actions that could
be taken to gather system and network information. System and network discovery
techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the
environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain
of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the
information obtained.
