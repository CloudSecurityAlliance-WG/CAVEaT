https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/004/ 3/5Process Injection: Asynchronous Procedure Call
Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based
defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. APC injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live
process.
APC injection is commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are
executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A handle to an existing victim process is ﬁrst created with native Windows API calls
such as OpenThread . At this point QueueUserAPC can be used to invoke a function (such as LoadLibrayA pointing to a malicious DLL).
A variation of APC injection, dubbed "Early Bird injection", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and
executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC. AtomBombing is another
variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table.
Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
elevated privileges. Execution via APC injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a
legitimate process.Other sub-techniques of Process Injection (12)

on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0009 Process OS API
ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a
signiﬁcant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under
speciﬁc circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions
may be common and diﬃcult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such
as SuspendThread /SetThreadContext /ResumeThread , QueueUserAPC /NtQueueApcThread ,
and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as
VirtualAllocEx /WriteProcessMemory , may be used for this technique.
Process
AccessMonitor for processes being viewed that may inject malicious code into processes via the
asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well as
possibly elevate privileges.
Process
ModiﬁcationMonitor for changes made to processes that may inject malicious code into processes via the
asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well as
possibly elevate privileges.[5]
