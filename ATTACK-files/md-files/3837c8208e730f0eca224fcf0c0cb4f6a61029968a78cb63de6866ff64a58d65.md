https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614/001/ 3/6System Location Discovery: System Language Discovery
Adversaries may attempt to gather information about the system language of a victim in order to infer the geographical location of that
host. This information may be used to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether the adversary infects the target and/or attempts
speciﬁc actions. This decision may be employed by malware developers and operators to reduce their risk of attracting the attention of
speciﬁc law enforcement agencies or prosecution/scrutiny from other entities.
There are various sources of data an adversary could use to infer system language, such as system defaults and keyboard layouts. Speciﬁc
checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve behaviors such as Query Registry and calls to Native API functions.
For example, on a Windows system adversaries may attempt to infer the language of a system by querying the registry key
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Language or parsing the outputs of Windows API functions
GetUserDefaultUILanguage , GetSystemDefaultUILanguage , GetKeyboardLayoutList and GetUserDefaultLangID .
On a macOS or Linux system, adversaries may query locale to retrieve the value of the $LANG environment variable.[1]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614/001/ 4/6Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0640 Avaddon Avaddon checks for speciﬁc keyboard layouts and OS languages to avoid targeting Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) entities.
S0534 Bazar Bazar can perform a check to ensure that the operating system's keyboard and language settings are not
set to Russian.
S0611 Clop Clop has checked the keyboard language using the GetKeyboardLayout() function to avoid installation
on Russian-language or other Commonwealth of Independent States-language machines; it will also
check the GetTextCharset function.
S0625 Cuba Cuba can check if Russian language is installed on the infected machine by using the function
GetKeyboardLayoutList .
S0616 DEATHRANSOM Some versions of DEATHRANSOM have performed language ID and keyboard layout checks; if either of
these matched Russian, Kazakh, Belarusian, Ukrainian or Tatar DEATHRANSOM would exit.
S0547 DropBook DropBook has checked for the presence of Arabic language in the infected machine's settings.
S0696 Flagpro Flagpro can check whether the target system is using Japanese, Taiwanese, or English through detection
of speciﬁc Windows Security and Internet Explorer dialog.
S0632 GrimAgent GrimAgent has used Accept-Language to identify hosts in the United Kingdom, United States, France,
and Spain.
G0004 Ke3chang Ke3chang has used implants to collect the system language ID of a compromised machine.
S0652 MarkiRAT MarkiRAT can use the GetKeyboardLayout API to check if a compromised host's keyboard is set to
Persian.
S0449 Maze Maze has checked the language of the machine with function GetUserDefaultUILanguage and
terminated execution if the language matches with an entry in the predeﬁned list.
S0083 Misdat Misdat has attempted to detect if a compromised host had a Japanese keyboard via the Windows API
call GetKeyboardType .
S0691 Neoichor Neoichor can identify the system language on a compromised host.
C0022 Operation Dream
JobDuring Operation Dream Job, Lazarus Group deployed malware designed not to run on computers set to
Korean, Japanese, or Chinese in Windows language preferences.
S0496 REvil REvil can check the system language using GetUserDefaultUILanguage and
GetSystemDefaultUILanguage . If the language is found in the list, the process terminates.
S0446 Ryuk Ryuk has been observed to query the registry key
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Language and the value
InstallLanguage . If the machine has the value 0x419 (Russian), 0x422 (Ukrainian), or 0x423
(Belarusian), it stops execution.
S0085 S-Type S-Type has attempted to determine if a compromised system was using a Japanese keyboard via the
GetKeyboardType API call.
S0546 SharpStage SharpStage has been used to target Arabic-speaking users and used code that checks if the
compromised machine has the Arabic language installed.
S0543 Spark Spark has checked the results of the GetKeyboardLayoutList and the language name returned by
GetLocaleInfoA to make sure they contain the word "Arabic" before executing.[6]

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614/001/ 5/6ID Name Description
S0242 SynAck SynAck lists all the keyboard layouts installed on the victim’s system using GetKeyboardLayoutList
API and checks against a hardcoded language code list. If a match if found, SynAck sleeps for 300
seconds and then exits without encrypting ﬁles.
S0658 XCSSET XCSSET uses AppleScript to check the host's language and location with the command user locale
of (get system info) .
S0330 Zeus Panda Zeus Panda queries the system's keyboard mapping to determine the language used on the system. It
will terminate execution if it detects LANG\_RUSSIAN, LANG\_BELARUSIAN, LANG\_KAZAK, or
LANG\_UKRAINIAN.
Mitigations
This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to gather
information about the system language of a victim in order to infer the
geographical location of that host.

language of a victim in order to infer the geographical location of that host.
Process Creation Monitor for newly executed processes that may attempt to gather information
about the system language of a victim in order to infer the geographical location
of that host.
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key AccessMonitor for access to windows registry keys that may attempt to gather
information about the system language of a victim in order to infer the
geographical location of that host.[5]
