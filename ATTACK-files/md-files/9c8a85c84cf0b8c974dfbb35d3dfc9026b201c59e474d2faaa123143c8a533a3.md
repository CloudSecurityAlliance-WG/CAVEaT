Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0016 APT29 APT29 has embedded an ISO ﬁle within an HTML attachment that contained JavaScript code to initiate
malware execution.
S0634 EnvyScout EnvyScout contains JavaScript code that can extract an encoded blob from its HTML body and write it to disk.
S0650 QakBot QakBot has been delivered in ZIP ﬁles via HTML smuggling.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1048 Application Isolation and
SandboxingBrowser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but
sandbox escapes may still exist.Adversaries may smuggle data and ﬁles past content ﬁlters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML ﬁles. HTML
documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be
constructed into ﬁle-like objects. Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME ﬁles inline of HTML
documents. HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate ﬁle downloads.
Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or
HTML5 download attributes. Security controls such as web content ﬁlters may not identify smuggled malicious ﬁles inside of HTML/JS
ﬁles, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as text/plain and/or text/html . Malicious ﬁles or data can be
obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML ﬁles through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the
victim (i.e. Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), potentially bypassing content ﬁlters.
For example, JavaScript Blobs can be abused to dynamically generate malicious ﬁles in the victim machine and may be dropped to disk by
abusing JavaScript functions such as msSaveBlob .Other sub-techniques of Obfuscated Files or Information (12)

DS0022 File File Creation Monitor for newly constructed ﬁles via JavaScript, developing rules for the different variants,
with a combination of different encoding and/or encryption schemes, may be very challenging.
Consider monitoring ﬁles downloaded from the Internet, possibly by HTML Smuggling, for
suspicious activities. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain
of behavior that could lead to other activities.
