https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/003/ 3/6Indicator Removal: Clear Command History
In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions
undertaken during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can
retrace what they've done.
On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in
a ﬁle pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE . When a user logs off a system, this information is ﬂushed to a ﬁle in the user's home
directory called ~/.bash\_history . The beneﬁt of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different
sessions.
Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history (history -c ) or deleting the bash history ﬁle rm
~/.bash\_history .
Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to clear command history data (clear logging and/or clear
history ).
On Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed by the
PSReadLine module. The built-in history only tracks the commands used in the current session. This command history is not available to
other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.
The PSReadLine command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a ﬁle
($env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost\_history.txt by default). This history ﬁle is available to all
sessions and contains all past history since the ﬁle is not deleted when the session ends.
Adversaries may run the PowerShell command Clear-History to ﬂush the entire command history from a current PowerShell session.
This, however, will not delete/ﬂush the ConsoleHost\_history.txt ﬁle. Adversaries may also delete the ConsoleHost\_history.txt ﬁle or
edit its contents to hide PowerShell commands they have run.Other sub-techniques of Indicator Removal (9)

ID Name Description
G0096 APT41 APT41 attempted to remove evidence of some of its activity by deleting Bash histories.
S0601 Hildegard Hildegard has used history -c to clear script shell logs.
S0641 Kobalos Kobalos can remove all command history on compromised hosts.
G0032 Lazarus
GroupLazarus Group has routinely deleted log ﬁles on a compromised router, including automatic log deletion
through the use of the logrotate utility.
G0059 Magic Hound Magic Hound has removed mailbox export requests from compromised Exchange servers.
G0045 menuPass menuPass has used Wevtutil to remove PowerShell execution logs.

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1039 Environment Variable
PermissionsMaking the environment variables associated with command history read only may ensure that
the history is preserved.
M1029 Remote Data Storage Forward logging of historical data to remote data store and centralized logging solution to
preserve historical command line log data.
M1022 Restrict File and Directory
PermissionsPreventing users from deleting or writing to certain ﬁles can stop adversaries from maliciously
altering their ~/.bash\_history or ConsoleHost\_history.txt ﬁles.[5]
