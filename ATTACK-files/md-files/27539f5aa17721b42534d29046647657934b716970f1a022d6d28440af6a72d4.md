Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0125 HAFNIUM HAFNIUM has interacted with Oﬃce 365 tenants to gather details regarding target's environments.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
ID Data Source Data ComponentDetects
DS0035 Internet Scan Response
ContentInternet scanners may be used to look for patterns associated with malicious content
designed to collect client conﬁguration information from visitors. Much of this activity
may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially
taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection diﬃcult for
defenders. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle,
such as during Initial Access.Adversaries may gather information about the victim's client conﬁgurations that can be used during targeting. Information about client
conﬁgurations may include a variety of details and settings, including operating system/version, virtualization, architecture (ex: 32 or 64 bit),
language, and/or time zone.
Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning (ex: listening ports, server
banners, user agent strings) or Phishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to
collect host information from visitors. Information about the client conﬁgurations may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other
accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may
reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases),
establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex: Supply Chain Compromise or
External Remote Services).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Host Information (4)
