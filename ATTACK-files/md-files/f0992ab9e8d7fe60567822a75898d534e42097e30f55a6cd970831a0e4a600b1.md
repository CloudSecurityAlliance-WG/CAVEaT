https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/002/ 3/5Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses
Adversaries may gather email addresses that can be used during targeting. Even if internal instances exist, organizations may have public-
facing email infrastructure and addresses for employees.
Adversaries may easily gather email addresses, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex:
Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites). Email addresses could also be enumerated via more active means (i.e. Active
Scanning), such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system. For
example, adversaries may be able to enumerate email addresses in Oﬃce 365 environments by querying a variety of publicly available API
endpoints, such as autodiscover and GetCredentialType.
Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Phishing for
Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Email Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing or Brute Force via External Remote
Services).Other sub-techniques of Gather Victim Identity Information (3)

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1056 Pre-
compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed
outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount
and sensitivity of data available to external parties.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0029 Network TraﬃcNetwork Traﬃc
ContentMonitor for suspicious network traﬃc that could be indicative of probing for email
addresses and/or usernames, such as large/iterative quantities of authentication
requests originating from a single source (especially if the source is known to be
associated with an adversary/botnet). Analyzing web metadata may also reveal artifacts
that can be attributed to potentially malicious activity, such as referer or user-agent string
HTTP/S ﬁelds.[6][7]
