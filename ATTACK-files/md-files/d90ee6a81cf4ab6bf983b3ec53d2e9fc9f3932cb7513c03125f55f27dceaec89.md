https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/ 3/9Data Encrypted for Impact
Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network
resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting ﬁles or data on local and remote drives and withholding access
to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption
key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.
In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user ﬁles like Oﬃce documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code ﬁles
will be encrypted (and often renamed and/or tagged with speciﬁc ﬁle markers). Adversaries may need to ﬁrst employ other behaviors, such
as File and Directory Permissions Modiﬁcation or System Shutdown/Reboot, in order to unlock and/or gain access to manipulate these ﬁles.
 In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system ﬁles, disk partitions, and the MBR.
To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a
network by leveraging other attack techniques like Valid Accounts, OS Credential Dumping, and SMB/Windows Admin Shares.
Encryption malware may also leverage Internal Defacement, such as changing victim wallpapers, or otherwise intimidate victims by sending
ransom notes or other messages to connected printers (known as "print bombing").
In cloud environments, storage objects within compromised accounts may also be encrypted.[1][2][3][4]

Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1040 Behavior
Prevention on
EndpointOn Windows 10, enable cloud-delivered protection and Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to block the
execution of ﬁles that resemble ransomware. 
M1053 Data Backup Consider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for regularly taking and testing
data backups that can be used to restore organizational data. Ensure backups are stored off system
and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and destroy the backups to
prevent recovery. Consider enabling versioning in cloud environments to maintain backup copies of
storage objects.
