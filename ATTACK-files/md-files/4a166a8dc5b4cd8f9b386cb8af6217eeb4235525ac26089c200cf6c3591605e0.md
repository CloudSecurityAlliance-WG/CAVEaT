Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0683 Peirates Peirates can query the Kubernetes API for secrets.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1035 Limit Access to
Resource Over
NetworkLimit communications with the container service to managed and secured channels, such as local Unix
sockets or remote access via SSH. Require secure port access to communicate with the APIs over TLS
by disabling unauthenticated access to the Docker API and Kubernetes API Server. In Kubernetes
clusters deployed in cloud environments, use native cloud platform features to restrict the IP ranges that
are permitted to access to API server. Where possible, consider enabling just-in-time (JIT) access to the
Kubernetes API to place additional restrictions on access.
M1030 Network
SegmentationDeny direct remote access to internal systems through the use of network proxies, gateways, and
ﬁrewalls.
M1026 Privileged
Account
ManagementUse the principle of least privilege for privileged accounts such as the service account in Kubernetes. For
example, if a pod is not required to access the Kubernetes API, consider disabling the service account
altogether.
M1018 User Account
ManagementEnforce authentication and role-based access control on the container API to restrict users to the least
privileges required. When using Kubernetes, avoid giving users wildcard permissions or adding users
to the system:masters group, and use RoleBindings rather than ClusterRoleBindings to limit user
privileges to speciﬁc namespaces.Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment. APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and
Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components.
An adversary may access the Docker API to collect logs that contain credentials to cloud, container, and various other resources in the
environment. An adversary with suﬃcient permissions, such as via a pod's service account, may also use the Kubernetes API to retrieve
credentials from the Kubernetes API server. These credentials may include those needed for Docker API authentication or secrets from
Kubernetes cluster components.Other sub-techniques of Unsecured Credentials (8)

DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionEstablish centralized logging for the activity of container and Kubernetes cluster
components. Monitor logs for actions that could be taken to gather credentials to
container and cloud infrastructure, including the use of discovery API calls by new or
unexpected users and APIs that access Docker logs.
