https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/006/ 3/5Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing Policy Modiﬁcation
Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of unsigned or self-signed code. Code signing provides a level of
authenticity on a program from a developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Security controls can include
enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on an operating system.
Some of these security controls may be enabled by default, such as Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) on Windows or System Integrity
Protection (SIP) on macOS. Other such controls may be disabled by default but are conﬁgurable through application controls, such as
only allowing signed Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) to execute on a system. Since it can be useful for developers to modify default signature
enforcement policies during the development and testing of applications, disabling of these features may be possible with elevated
permissions.
Adversaries may modify code signing policies in a number of ways, including through use of command-line or GUI utilities, Modify Registry,
rebooting the computer in a debug/recovery mode, or by altering the value of variables in kernel memory. Examples of commands
that can modify the code signing policy of a system include bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON on Windows and csrutil disable on
macOS. Depending on the implementation, successful modiﬁcation of a signing policy may require reboot of the compromised system.
Additionally, some implementations can introduce visible artifacts for the user (ex: a watermark in the corner of the screen stating the
system is in Test Mode). Adversaries may attempt to remove such artifacts.
To gain access to kernel memory to modify variables related to signature checks, such as modifying g\_CiOptions to disable Driver
Signature Enforcement, adversaries may conduct Exploitation for Privilege Escalation using a signed, but vulnerable driver.Other sub-techniques of Subvert Trust Controls (6)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/006/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
G0087 APT39 APT39 has used malware to turn off the RequireSigned feature which ensures only signed DLLs can be run
on Windows.
S0089 BlackEnergy BlackEnergy has enabled the TESTSIGNING boot conﬁguration option to facilitate loading of a driver
component.
S0009 Hikit Hikit has attempted to disable driver signing veriﬁcation by tampering with several Registry keys prior to the
loading of a rootkit driver component.
S0664 Pandora Pandora can use CVE-2017-15303 to disable Windows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) protection and
load its driver.
G0010 Turla Turla has modiﬁed variables in kernel memory to turn off Driver Signature Enforcement after exploiting
vulnerabilities that obtained kernel mode privileges.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1046 Boot Integrity Use of Secure Boot may prevent some implementations of modiﬁcation to code signing policies.
M1026 Privileged Account
ManagementLimit the usage of local administrator and domain administrator accounts to be used for day-to-
day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries.
M1024 Restrict Registry
PermissionsEnsure proper permissions are set for the Registry to prevent users from modifying keys related to
code signing policies.
Detection
ID Data Source Data Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor for the execution of commands that could modify the code signing policy
of a system, such as bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON . 
DS0009 Process Process Creation Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken
to modify the code signing policy of a system, such as bcdedit.exe -set
TESTSIGNING ON . 
DS0024 Windows RegistryWindows Registry
Key ModiﬁcationConsider monitoring for modiﬁcations made to Registry keys associated with
code signing policies, such as HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
NT\Driver Signing . Modiﬁcations to the code signing policy of a system are
likely to be rare.[9]
