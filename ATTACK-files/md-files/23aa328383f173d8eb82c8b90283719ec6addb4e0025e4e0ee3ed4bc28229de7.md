https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/ 3/5Execution Guardrails
Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment speciﬁc
conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and
reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use
as guardrails may include speciﬁc network share names, attached physical devices, ﬁles, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and
local/external IP addresses.
Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This
use of guardrails is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion. While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking
for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an
expected target-speciﬁc value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.Sub-techniques (1)

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/ 4/5Procedure Examples
ID Name Description
S0504 Anchor Anchor can terminate itself if speciﬁc execution ﬂags are not present.
S0570 BitPaymer BitPaymer compares ﬁle names and paths to a list of excluded names and directory names during encryption.
S0635 BoomBox BoomBox can check its current working directory and for the presence of a speciﬁc ﬁle and terminate if speciﬁc
values are not found.
S1052 DEADEYE DEADEYE can ensure it executes only on intended systems by identifying the victim's volume serial number,
hostname, and/or DNS domain.
S0634 EnvyScout EnvyScout can call window.location.pathname to ensure that embedded ﬁles are being executed from the C:
drive, and will terminate if they are not.
S0637 NativeZone NativeZone can check for the presence of KM.EkeyAlmaz1C.dll and will halt execution unless it is in the same
directory as the rest of the malware's components.
S1035 Small
SieveSmall Sieve can only execute correctly if the word Platypus is passed to it on the command line.
S0603 Stuxnet Stuxnet checks for speciﬁc operating systems on 32-bit machines, Registry keys, and dates for vulnerabilities,
and will exit execution if the values are not met.
S0562 SUNSPOT SUNSPOT only replaces SolarWinds Orion source code if the MD5 checksums of both the original source code
ﬁle and backdoored replacement source code match hardcoded values.
S0678 Torisma Torisma is only delivered to a compromised host if the victim's IP address is on an allow-list.
S0636 VaporRage VaporRage has the ability to check for the presence of a speciﬁc DLL and terminate if it is not found.
Mitigations
ID Mitigation Description
M1055 Do Not
MitigateExecution Guardrails likely should not be mitigated with preventative controls because it may protect
unintended targets from being compromised. If targeted, efforts should be focused on preventing adversary
tools from running earlier in the chain of activity and on identifying subsequent malicious behavior if
compromised.
Detection
ID Data SourceData Component Detects
DS0017 Command Command
ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may gather information about the victim's
business relationships that can be used during targeting. Detecting the use of guardrails may
be diﬃcult depending on the implementation.
DS0009 Process Process
CreationMonitoring for suspicious processes being spawned that gather a variety of system
information or perform other forms of Discovery, especially in a short period of time, may aid
in detection. Detecting the use of guardrails may be diﬃcult depending on the
implementation.[3]
