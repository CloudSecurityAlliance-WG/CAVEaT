# TODO

* Identify which CAVEaT files are vendor specific and need a more vendor neutral writeup and coverage with AWS/Azure/GCE.
* Figure out a new template
  * Description
  * Examples
  * Mitigations
  * Detection
  * References
* Additional data
  * AWS/Azure/GCE and other vendor and service specific information
  * Mappings to other standards

## Mappings

* Mapping to categories from ATT&CK, FIGHT and so on
* Mapping to CSA CCM (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/cloud-controls-matrix-v4) including mitigations, controls, etc.
* Mapping to CSA Top Threats report (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/topics/top-threats) including mitigations, controls, etc.
* Mapping to CWE (https://cwe.mitre.org/)
