Insufficient permissions on model storage, registries, training pipelines, or deployment processes enable unauthorized access, modifications, or exfiltration. Common issues include overly permissive IAM policies, lack of resource-level permissions, missing authorization checks, and inadequate separation of duties between ML development, operations, and security teams.",
