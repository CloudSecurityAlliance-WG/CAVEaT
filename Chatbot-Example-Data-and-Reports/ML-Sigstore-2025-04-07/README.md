# ML Model Security in Cloud Environments: STIX Documentation

## Executive Summary

This repository contains structured STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) documentation for Machine Learning (ML) model security threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations in cloud environments. It was created in response to the growing need for standardized security documentation specific to ML workloads in cloud platforms, particularly in light of emerging standards like model signing with Sigstore.

The documentation covers 10 attack patterns, 10 vulnerabilities, and 9 courses of action, with specific implementation details for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It also includes platform-level architectural recommendations that cloud providers could implement to fundamentally enhance ML security posture.

## Background

Machine learning models deployed in cloud environments face unique security challenges throughout their lifecycle. From training data poisoning to model tampering and adversarial attacks, these threats differ significantly from traditional application security concerns. The increasing adoption of ML systems in critical infrastructure, healthcare, financial services, and other sensitive domains makes securing these systems paramount.

This STIX documentation focuses particularly on model integrity verification through cryptographic signing using Sigstore, a project that brings supply chain security practices to ML artifacts. By implementing model signing and verification, organizations can ensure the authenticity and integrity of ML models throughout the deployment pipeline.

## Threat Landscape

The documented attack patterns fall into three primary categories:

### Model Integrity Attacks
* **ML Model Tampering**: Modification of legitimate models during deployment or storage
* **ML Model Injection**: Insertion of unauthorized models into production environments
* **ML Model Checkpoint Hijacking**: Interception and replacement of model checkpoints during training
* **ML Registry Manipulation**: Unauthorized access to model registries to swap legitimate models with malicious ones

### Data Security Attacks
* **ML Training Data Poisoning**: Contamination of training datasets to influence model behavior
* **ML Model Extraction**: Stealing models through repeated API queries
* **ML Inference Data Exfiltration**: Extracting sensitive data used for model inference
* **ML Adversarial Example Attacks**: Crafting inputs specifically designed to cause misclassification

### Infrastructure and Pipeline Attacks
* **ML Pipeline Compromise**: Attacking CI/CD pipelines used for ML model deployment
* **ML Framework Exploitation**: Leveraging vulnerabilities in ML libraries/frameworks

## Key Vulnerabilities

The documented vulnerabilities include:

### Model Security Vulnerabilities
* **Unsigned ML Models**: Lack of cryptographic signatures for model verification
* **Inadequate ML Provenance Tracking**: Inability to verify model origin and lineage
* **Unversioned Model Assets**: Lack of proper versioning for models and training data
* **Insecure Model Serialization**: Vulnerabilities in model serialization formats

### Access Control and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
* **Inadequate Access Controls for ML Resources**: Insufficient permissions on model storage and deployment
* **Unencrypted ML Model Transfer**: Models transmitted without encryption between services
* **Weak ML Pipeline Authentication**: Insufficient verification in automated ML workflows
* **Exposed Model Endpoints**: Publicly accessible inference endpoints without proper protection
* **Shared Tenancy Risks**: Cross-tenant vulnerabilities in cloud-based ML platforms
* **Excessive ML Model Runtime Permissions**: ML models running with more privileges than needed

## Mitigation Strategies

The documented courses of action include:

### Model Integrity and Verification
* **Implement ML Model Signing with Sigstore**: Cryptographically sign ML models to verify authenticity
* **Establish ML Model Provenance Framework**: Track and verify the complete lineage of models
* **Implement Immutable ML Model Versioning**: Establish immutable versioning for ML assets

### Access Control and Monitoring
* **Deploy ML-Specific Access Controls**: Implement least-privilege access to model resources
* **Enable End-to-End ML Model Encryption**: Encrypt models at rest and in transit
* **Deploy ML-Specific Monitoring and Threat Detection**: Implement real-time monitoring for unusual model behavior

### Pipeline and Infrastructure Security
* **Create Secure ML Model Deployment Pipelines**: Build secure CI/CD pipelines specific to ML workflows
* **Implement ML Model Verification Testing**: Test models for unexpected behaviors prior to deployment
* **Implement ML Model Runtime Security**: Deploy security controls for model serving infrastructure

## Implementation Across Cloud Providers

Each course of action includes specific implementation guidance for:

* **AWS**: Using services like SageMaker, AWS Signer, KMS, CloudTrail, and IAM
* **Azure**: Using services like Azure Machine Learning, Key Vault, Azure Monitor, and Azure RBAC
* **GCP**: Using services like Vertex AI, Cloud KMS, Cloud Build, and Cloud IAM

## Platform-Level Architectural Recommendations

Beyond customer-level mitigations, this documentation includes recommendations for cloud providers to implement fundamental architectural changes that would enhance ML security:

* Native model signing capabilities directly integrated with ML platforms
* Standardized ML Bill of Materials (MLBOM) framework for provenance tracking
* Native immutable model registries with cryptographic integrity verification
* ML-specific identity and access management frameworks
* Specialized ML encryption frameworks supporting privacy-preserving inference
* ML-specific security monitoring frameworks with adversarial detection capabilities
* Secure ML pipeline frameworks with built-in security controls
* Specialized ML model verification frameworks for security testing
* ML runtime security frameworks with confidential computing support

## Relationship Visualization

The relationships between attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and courses of action are visualized in the `relationship-diagram.md` file using Mermaid diagrams. This visualization helps security practitioners understand how different threats exploit specific vulnerabilities and how mitigation strategies address these risks.
