  "description": "The SAML 2.0 protocol has inherent design limitations in its token validation mechanism, particularly in IdP-initiated flows where no interaction with the identity provider is required after obtaining a valid SAML response. These limitations can be exploited in attacks like Silver SAML where the signing key has been compromised.",
