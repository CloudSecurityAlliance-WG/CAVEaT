  "description": "Cloud providers should implement additional validation parameters in SAML assertions that are strongly tied to user identity and cannot be easily forged. This could include cryptographic proof of recent authentication, hardware attestation, or other tamper-resistant identity signals that go beyond what is included in a standard SAML assertion.",
