  "description": "A confused deputy attack in AWS S3 occurs when a service (the 'deputy') with permissions to access resources can be manipulated by a third party to perform actions that the third party doesn't have permission to perform directly. In the context of S3, this commonly happens with cross-account access scenarios where a bucket policy allows a specific AWS service to access a bucket but doesn't properly restrict which account can use that service to access the bucket.",
