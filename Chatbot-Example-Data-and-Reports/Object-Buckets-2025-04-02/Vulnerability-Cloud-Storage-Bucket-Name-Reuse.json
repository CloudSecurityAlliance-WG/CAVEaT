    "description": "Cloud storage services (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) allow bucket/container names to be reused after deletion. When a storage bucket is deleted but references to it remain in applications, DNS records, or other infrastructure, an attacker can re-register the same bucket name and gain control of content delivery, potentially leading to supply chain attacks, data interception, or malware distribution.",
