    "description": "Cloud providers should implement tenant-specific namespacing for storage resources to prevent bucket re-registration attacks. This architectural change ensures that resource names are permanently associated with specific tenants or organizations, making it impossible for attackers to re-register previously used names belonging to other tenants.",

            "Create organization-level reserved name registries that persist even after resource deletion",
