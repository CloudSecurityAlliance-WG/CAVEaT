# Cloud Storage Bucket Re-registration Attack

## Overview

This directory contains STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) data and supporting documentation related to a cloud security threat analysis conducted on April 2, 2025. The analysis focuses on a technique where attackers exploit deleted cloud storage buckets (like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) by re-registering them under their control, potentially leading to malware distribution, supply chain attacks, and data interception.

## Directory Contents

### STIX Objects

1. **Attack Pattern**
   - `Attack-Pattern-Cloud-Storage-Bucket-Reregistration.json` - Defines the technique used by threat actors to exploit deleted cloud storage resources

2. **Vulnerabilities**
   - `Vulnerability-Cloud-Storage-Bucket-Name-Reuse.json` - Documents the vulnerability that allows bucket names to be reused after deletion
   - `Vulnerability-Abandoned-DNS-Records.json` - Documents the vulnerability of abandoned DNS records pointing to deleted cloud resources

3. **Courses of Action**
   - `Course-of-Action-AWS-S3-Protection.json` - Implementation steps for protecting AWS S3 buckets
   - `Course-of-Action-Azure-Blob-Storage-Protection.json` - Implementation steps for protecting Azure Blob Storage
   - `Course-of-Action-GCP-Storage-Protection.json` - Implementation steps for protecting Google Cloud Storage

4. **Relationships**
   - `Relationship-Attack-Pattern-To-Vulnerability-Bucket-Reuse.json` - Links the attack pattern to the bucket reuse vulnerability
   - `Relationship-Attack-Pattern-To-Vulnerability-DNS-Records.json` - Links the attack pattern to the abandoned DNS records vulnerability
   - `Relationship-AWS-COA-To-Vulnerability.json` - Links the AWS protection measures to the vulnerability
   - `Relationship-Azure-COA-To-Vulnerability.json` - Links the Azure protection measures to the vulnerability
   - `Relationship-GCP-COA-To-Vulnerability.json` - Links the GCP protection measures to the vulnerability

### Supporting Documentation

1. **Research Report**
   - `CAVEaT-Research-Report.md` - Comprehensive analysis including threat description, impact analysis, mitigation strategies, and references

2. **Visualization**
   - `STIX-Relationship-Diagram.mmd` - Mermaid diagram file showing the relationships between STIX objects

## Key Findings

- This attack vector has been documented with real-world examples, particularly affecting AWS S3 buckets
- The potential impact is severe, with researchers suggesting it could lead to "the largest supply chain attack in history"
- All major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) have similar vulnerabilities but offer different protection mechanisms
- Effective mitigation requires a combination of technical controls and operational procedures

## Using This Data

The STIX data in this directory can be imported into threat intelligence platforms that support STIX 2.1 format. The relationships between objects are defined to show how the attack pattern exploits vulnerabilities and how the courses of action mitigate those vulnerabilities.

The comprehensive research report provides detailed information for security teams to understand the threat and implement appropriate protections. The report includes provider-specific mitigation strategies with implementation details for web consoles, command-line interfaces, and APIs.
