# Cloud Storage Bucket Re-registration Attack

## Overview

This directory contains STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) data and supporting documentation related to a cloud security threat analysis conducted on April 2, 2025. The analysis focuses on a technique where attackers exploit deleted cloud storage buckets (like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) by re-registering them under their control, potentially leading to malware distribution, supply chain attacks, and data interception.

2. **Visualization**
   - `STIX-Relationship-Diagram.mmd` - Mermaid diagram file showing the relationships between STIX objects
   - `STIX-Relationship-Diagram-Updated.mmd` - Updated diagram including platform-level mitigations

## Key Findings

- This attack vector has been documented with real-world examples, particularly affecting AWS S3 buckets
- The potential impact is severe, with researchers suggesting it could lead to "the largest supply chain attack in history"
- All major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) have similar vulnerabilities but offer different protection mechanisms
- Effective mitigation requires a combination of customer-level controls and platform-level architectural changes

## Platform-Level Mitigation Approaches

This directory includes analysis of five key platform-level mitigations that cloud providers could implement:

1. **Tenant Namespacing** - Implementing tenant-specific namespaces for resource names, preventing cross-tenant reuse
2. **DNS and Name Reservation Policies** - Extended reservation periods and restricted reclamation of resource names
3. **Strong Identity Binding** - Cryptographically linking resource names to organizational identities
4. **Enhanced Resource Lifecycle Management** - Comprehensive dependency tracking and staged deletion processes
5. **Resource Abstraction Layer** - Architectural separation of user-facing names from underlying resources

These platform-level mitigations address the root cause of the vulnerability rather than relying solely on customer vigilance and proper configuration.

## Using This Data

The STIX data in this directory can be imported into threat intelligence platforms that support STIX 2.1 format. The relationships between objects are defined to show how the attack pattern exploits vulnerabilities and how various courses of action (both customer-level and platform-level) mitigate those vulnerabilities.

The comprehensive research report provides detailed information for security teams to understand the threat and implement appropriate protections. The report includes provider-specific mitigation strategies with implementation details for web consoles, command-line interfaces, and APIs.
