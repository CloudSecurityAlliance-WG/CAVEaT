    "description": "When cloud resources such as storage buckets are deleted but DNS records (CNAME, Alias, etc.) pointing to those resources remain active, attackers can re-register those resources and gain control of the associated subdomain. This is often referred to as subdomain takeover and can lead to content spoofing, malware distribution, and data interception.",
