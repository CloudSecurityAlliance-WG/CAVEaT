    "name": "Implement Strong Identity Binding for Resource Names",
    "description": "Cloud providers should implement strong identity binding mechanisms that permanently associate resource names with specific identity providers, verified domains, or organizations. This prevents attackers from being able to register resource names that were previously associated with other entities.",

            "Permanently bind certain resource name patterns to specific identity providers or verified domains",

            "Implement DNS verification of domain ownership before allowing creation of buckets with names that match patterns of previously deleted buckets",
            "Create cryptographic associations between resource names and organizational identities that persist beyond resource lifecycle",
