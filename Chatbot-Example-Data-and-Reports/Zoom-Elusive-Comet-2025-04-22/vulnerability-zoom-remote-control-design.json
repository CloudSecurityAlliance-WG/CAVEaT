  "name": "Zoom Remote Control Feature Design Vulnerability",
  "description": "This vulnerability exists in the design of Zoom's remote control feature, which allows meeting participants to request control of another participant's screen and computer. The vulnerability stems from several design weaknesses: 1) The user interface does not clearly distinguish between system notifications and participant actions, allowing attackers to rename themselves as 'Zoom' to make control requests appear as system prompts; 2) The permission dialog does not adequately communicate the security implications of granting remote control; 3) Default settings allow any meeting participant to request remote control; 4) The feature grants extensive system-level access beyond what is typically expected in a collaboration tool. While not a code vulnerability per se, this design vulnerability enables social engineering attacks by exploiting users' trust in the Zoom platform and their tendency to approve prompts in the context of business meetings.",
