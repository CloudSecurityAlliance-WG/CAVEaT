  "description": "An adversary exploits Zoom's screen sharing remote control feature to gain unauthorized access to a victim's system. The attack begins with social engineering, where the adversary establishes a seemingly legitimate business context (often posing as media representatives) to initiate a Zoom call with the target. During the call, the adversary requests remote control access of the victim's screen. To increase success probability, the adversary may change their display name to 'Zoom' to make the request appear as a system notification rather than a participant action. If the victim grants permission, the adversary gains complete control over the victim's computer, allowing them to install malware, exfiltrate sensitive data, or access cryptocurrency wallets and assets. This technique is particularly effective because it exploits a legitimate feature within a trusted application and occurs during what appears to be normal business activity.",
