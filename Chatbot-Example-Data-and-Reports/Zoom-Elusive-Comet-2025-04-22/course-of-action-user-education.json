  "description": "This course of action focuses on educating users about the risks associated with Zoom's remote control feature and training them to recognize and respond appropriately to social engineering attacks that exploit this functionality. While technical controls provide the strongest protection, user awareness forms a critical secondary defense layer, especially for organizations that cannot immediately implement technical mitigations or for individual users without enterprise support.",
