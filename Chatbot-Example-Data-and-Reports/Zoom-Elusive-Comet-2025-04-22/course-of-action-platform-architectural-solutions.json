  "name": "Platform-Level Architectural Solutions for Zoom Remote Control Vulnerability",
  "description": "This course of action outlines fundamental architectural changes that Zoom could implement to address the remote control feature vulnerability at a platform level. Unlike tactical mitigations that rely on user or administrator actions, these solutions represent systemic changes to the Zoom platform itself that would fundamentally eliminate or significantly reduce the risk posed by the remote control feature. These recommendations are directed at the cloud service provider (Zoom) rather than end users, though they could be advocated for by enterprise customers and security researchers.",
