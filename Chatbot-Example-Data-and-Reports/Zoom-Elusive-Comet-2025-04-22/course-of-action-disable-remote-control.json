  "name": "Disable Zoom Remote Control Feature Entirely",
  "description": "This course of action involves completely disabling the remote control feature in Zoom settings at either the organizational or individual user level. By disabling this functionality, the attack vector is eliminated entirely, as attackers cannot request control of a user's computer during Zoom meetings. This represents the most secure option but may impact legitimate use cases for remote collaboration or technical support within an organization.",
