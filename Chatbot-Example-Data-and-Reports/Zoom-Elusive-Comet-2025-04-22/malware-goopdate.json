  "description": "GOOPDATE is a malware deployed by the ELUSIVE COMET threat actor during Zoom remote control attacks. Once installed on a victim's system after remote access is granted, it specifically targets cryptocurrency wallet credentials, private keys, and other sensitive financial information. The malware is designed to operate covertly and exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled infrastructure. Its name appears to be chosen to blend in with legitimate Google update processes (like 'GoogleUpdate'), making it less likely to raise suspicion if observed in system processes.",
