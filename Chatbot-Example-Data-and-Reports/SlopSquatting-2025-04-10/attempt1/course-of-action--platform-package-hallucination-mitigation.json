  "description": "Recommended architectural changes that cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) could implement to fundamentally address the risk of package hallucinations in LLM-generated code. These platform-level solutions focus on structural changes that would prevent exploitation of hallucinated packages.",

      "solution_name": "Package Registry Verification Layers",
      "description": "Cloud providers could implement a verification layer for package registries that validates package authenticity and popularity before allowing installation in cloud environments. This would prevent newly registered packages with hallucinated names from being automatically installed.",
      "implementation_considerations": [
        "Develop unified package verification APIs across major public registries",
        "Create a popularity and age threshold for packages to be considered trustworthy",
        "Implement package quarantine for newly published packages with low usage metrics",
        "Provide override mechanisms for legitimate use cases with proper authentication"

      "solution_name": "Tenant-Namespaced Package Registries",
      "description": "Cloud providers could create tenant-specific namespaces for package registries, ensuring that each customer environment can only access approved packages from trusted sources. This would prevent cross-tenant exploitation of hallucinated packages.",
      "implementation_considerations": [
        "Create tenant-specific views of public repositories with custom filtering rules",
        "Implement automated package vetting processes for new package additions",

      "implementation_considerations": [
        "Integrate RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) techniques to verify packages against known repositories",

      "solution_name": "Enhanced Resource Lifecycle Management",
      "description": "Cloud providers could implement stronger lifecycle controls for package management, including cooldown periods before package names can be reused, strict verification for newly registered packages, and improved monitoring of package repository activity.",
      "implementation_considerations": [
        "Institute mandatory waiting periods before deleted package names can be reregistered",
        "Create reputation systems for package publishers to establish trust over time",
