  "description": "Adversaries exploit non-existent package names generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) during code generation to conduct supply chain attacks. When code-generating LLMs suggest fictitious package names ('hallucinations'), attackers monitor these outputs and publish malicious packages with the hallucinated names to public repositories. Unsuspecting users who implement LLM-generated code containing these references then download and install the attacker-controlled packages. This attack is particularly effective in cloud environments where automated CI/CD pipelines and serverless functions may automatically install required dependencies without human verification. Across major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), serverless function services and container environments are especially susceptible as they often rely on package manifests that could include hallucinated dependencies.",
