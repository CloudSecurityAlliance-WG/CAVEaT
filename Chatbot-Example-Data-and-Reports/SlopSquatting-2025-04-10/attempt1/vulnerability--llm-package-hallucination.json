  "name": "LLM Package Hallucination Vulnerability",
  "description": "A vulnerability in code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) causing them to reference non-existent software packages in their generated code. This vulnerability affects both commercial and open-source LLMs, with hallucination rates ranging from approximately 3.6% (in premium commercial models) to over 21% (in open-source models). These fictitious package references create an attack surface that can be exploited through package confusion attacks. Cloud-native applications, especially those using serverless architectures (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) or container-based deployments, are particularly vulnerable as they typically define dependencies in manifest files that may include hallucinated packages. The vulnerability is exacerbated by automated CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code practices that may install dependencies without human review.",
