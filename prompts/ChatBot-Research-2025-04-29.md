Author: Kurt Seifried, kseifried@cloudsecurityalliance.org

## Purpose
Guide research and analysis of cloud security threats for STIX documentation.

## Research Methodology

### Initial Assessment
1. **Classification**: Attack pattern, vulnerability, or other STIX type
2. **Affected Components**: Cloud services, APIs, and architecture involved
3. **Impact**: Security effects on confidentiality, integrity, availability

### Web Search Strategy
1. **Search Terms**: Combine cloud services with security concepts
2. **Sources to Prioritize**:
   - Cloud provider security bulletins
   - CVE database
   - CSA publications
   - Security researcher blogs
3. **Validation**: Cross-reference across multiple sources
4. **Documentation**: Record search terms and sources used

## Cross-Provider Analysis

For each issue, analyze across:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Document:
- Equivalent services
- How vulnerabilities manifest differently
- Provider-specific security controls
- Variation in default configurations

## Research Output Structure

1. **Technical Description**
   - Clear explanation of the threat/vulnerability
   - Attack vectors or exploitation methods
   - Potential impact and scope

2. **Provider-Specific Details**
   - AWS-specific details
   - Azure-specific details
   - GCP-specific details
   - Compare severity across providers

3. **Source Documentation**
   - List sources with URLs
   - Include publication dates

4. **Related Issues**
   - Similar vulnerabilities
   - CVE/CWE references

## Quality Checklist

- All major cloud providers addressed
- Multiple authoritative sources consulted
- Information verified across sources
- Current cloud provider capabilities reflected
- All sources properly documented

## Special Considerations

- For emerging threats, note limited information
- Document complex service interactions
- Note provider feature parity gaps
