Description 
Both Azure and AWS employ security services that enable the inclusion of IP addresses 
that should be permitted through firewalls or should be ignored by services such as 
AWS Guard Duty. An adversary can add a simple IP address rule that likely will be 
missed by security personnel and will effectively negate the effectiveness of future 
security controls. 
 
Examples 
Name Description 
guardduty\_whitelist\_ip (Pacu Module) 
 Publicly available Pacu module that inserts trusted IP 
addresses within the Guard Duty service effectively 
causing Guard Duty to ignore all traffic involving these 
IPs. 
 
Mitigations 
Mitigation Description 
Audit Frequently check permissions on cloud storage to 
ensure proper permissions are set to deny open or 
unprivileged access to resources. Consider using 
automated resource checkers such as CloudSploit or 
Divvycloud. Frequently check changes to the 
configurations of cloud detection services, firewalls and 
security groups. 
 AWS To perform an audit via AWS it is suggested to review 
information such as account details (credentials, users, 
groups, roles, etc), mobile applications, EC2 
configurations, policies, and account activity. How to 
audit these different factors can be found i n detail at: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws -
security -audit -guide.html. 
 Azure To perform an audit via Azure an administrator can 
review the audit logs that are recorded under Azure’s 
monitoring for active directory. The audit logs allow for 
filtering, as well as looking at users, groups, and 
enterprise specific information. Full det ails on how to 
access this information can be found at: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en -us/azure/active -
directory/reports -monitoring/concept -audit -logs.

 GCP To perform an audit via GCP the logs can be reviewed. 
GCP breaks this down into three categories; admin 
activity, data access, and system events. The audit logs 
can be viewed a few different ways - the console, API, 
or gcloud. Full details on how to view th ese logs, how to 
export, and for how to configure the retention period 
can be found here:

Detection 
Detection Description 
Create Log Metric Filters and Alarms for AWS To create a metric filter and alarm: 
1. Create a metric filter that checks for IAM policy 
changes and the  
2. Create an SNS topic 
3. Create an SNS subscription to the above topic 
4. Create an alarm associated with the filter and SNS 
topic created in steps 1 and 2 respectively 
Monitor Activity in AWS Account Various services in AWS offer logging features that allow for 
detection capabilities. These include CloudFront, CloudTrail, 
CloudWatch, Config, and S3. 
Monitor for Suspicious Activity in Azure Azure AD can generate anomaly reports than can be run on 
a daily basis. Azure AD Identity Protection show current risks 
in its dashboard and provides daily email summary 
notifications. Policies can also be configured to alert to 
specific issues. 
Create Log Metric Filters and Alarms for CloudTrail To create a metric filter and alarm: 
1. Create a filter that checks for CloudTrail changes 
and the specific  
2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify 
3. Create an SNS subscription to the above topic 
4. Create an alarm associated with the filter from 
step 1 and SNS topic in step 2
