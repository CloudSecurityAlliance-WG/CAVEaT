 Exploiting Public -Facing Application (version 1.0) 
 
Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS 
 
Description 
The use of software, data, or commands to take advantage of a weakness in an 
Internet -facing computer system or program in order to cause unintended or 
unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design 
vulnerability. Th ese applications are often websites, but can include databases (like 
SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), and any other applications with Internet 
accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services. 
If an application is hosted on cloud -based infrastructure, then exploiting it may lead to 
compromise of the underlying instance. This can allow an adversary a path to access 
the cloud APIs or to take advantage of weak identity and access management policie s. 
It should be assumed that a public web server is a weak link inside a cloud deployment 
and that some level of compromise is possible. Using Zero Trust principles to isolate 
the web server to the maximum extent possible inside a cloud deployment will re duce 
the likelihood of several Cloud tactics and techniques. Docker APIs are commonly 
exposed publicly and can be used to gain access to a shell on the container, which are 
also known to run as root by default. 
 
For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most 
common web -based vulnerabilities. 
 
Examples 
Name Description 
Shodan.io Entering queries into Shodan.io like “Product ‘Docker’” 
or “Product ‘aws’” will yield results to various open APIs 
and public -facing services. 
Exposed Docker Port Identifying an open port associated with Docker (2376 
is the most common open port by default) can lead to 
finding running containers and images. Most containers 
run with default root privileges, so running docker -H

 192.168.1.7:2376 exec -it  /bin/bash 
will automatically give you root once logged in. 
 
 
 
Mitigations 
Mitigation Description 
Application Isolation and Sandboxing 
 
 Application isolation will limit what other processes and 
system features the exploited target can access. 
Exploit Protection Web Application Firewalls may be used to limit 
exposure of applications to prevent exploit traffic from 
reaching the application. 
Network Segmentation Segment externally facing servers and services from 
the rest of the network with a DMZ or on separate 
hosting infrastructure. 
Least Privilege All access given to users in the cloud environment 
should be assigned by the necessary privileges needed 
for team members to complete their job responsibilities. 
Ensure that temporary access tokens are issued rather 
than permanent credentials, especially when access is 
being granted to entities outside of the internal security 
boundary . 
 AWS To implement least privilege in an AWS environment 
IAM policies will be used. This gives the ability to allow 
users to perform list, read, write, permissions 
management, or tagging actions. AWS suggests 
utilizing last accessed information and A WS CloudTrail 
event history to get a better understanding of privileges 
that might be needed or reduced based on a specific 
role. Full details can be found at 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/
best-practices.html#grant -least -privilege. 
 Azure To implement least privilege in an Azure environment 
Azure Active Directory roles will be used. Azure outlines 
different tasks and the least privileged role that are 
suggested to be associated with the task. Those details 
can be found at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en -
us/azure/active -directory/users -groups -roles/roles -
delegate -by-task. To learn how to assign specific roles 
it can be done via the Azure Active Directory Portal. 
Instructions on how to assign roles can be found here: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/ en-us/azure/active -
directory/users -groups -roles/directory -manage -
roles -portal. 
 GCP To implement least privilege in GCP it is recommended 
to use predefined roles (which allow for granular access 
permissions) instead of primitive roles (roles/owner, 
roles/editor, and roles/viewer). Full details on the 
difference between types of roles can be found here: 
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding -
roles. To assign these roles IAM service accounts are 
used and complete details can be found at:

Update Software Regularly scan externally facing systems for 
vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly patch 
systems when critical vulnerabilities are discovered 
through scanning and through public disclosure. 
Vulnerability Scanning Regularly scan externally facing systems for 
vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly patch 
systems when critical vulnerabilities are discovered 
through scanning and through public disclosure. 
Disable Unnecessary Ports and Services Ensure ports and services that are publicly accessible 
are locked down and disabled if necessary. In the case 
of Docker, port 2376. 
Assign Permissions to Containers By default, many containers will run as root. Before 
provisioning the container, set explicit permissions and 
users in either the Dockerfile or User ID at runtime to 
ensure this does not happen. 
 
Detection 
Monitor application logs for abnormal behavior that may indicate attempted or 
successful exploitation. Use deep packet inspection to look for artifacts of common 
exploit traffic, such as SQL injection. Cloud -based Web Application Firewalls tied to 
proxies may detect improper requests attempting exploitation.
