**ID**: CAVEAT-XXXX  
**Name**: Single-Stepping CPU Attacks  
**Category**: Side-Channel & Timing-Based Attacks  
**Affected Platforms**: AWS (EC2, Nitro Enclaves), Azure (VMs, Confidential Computing), GCP (Compute Engine), OpenStack  
**Targeted Layers**: CPU Execution, Hypervisor, Cryptographic Processes

---

## Description:
Single-stepping attacks involve controlling the execution of CPU instructions step-by-step. In cloud environments, attackers can use privileged access, such as hypervisor control, to manipulate CPU execution timing, extracting cryptographic keys or other sensitive data. These attacks are a significant threat in virtualized environments and are often combined with side-channel techniques like cache timing attacks.

---

## Impact:
- **Confidentiality Breach**: Attackers can extract cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **Performance Degradation**: Performance issues may arise from resource contention or increased CPU cycle usage.
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive customer or application data may be compromised in multi-tenant environments.

---

## Affected Platforms:

### AWS (EC2, Nitro Enclaves):
AWS's Nitro System mitigates single-stepping risks by providing dedicated hardware isolation between instances. However, specific instance types (e.g., burstable instances) could still be vulnerable to timing-based attacks due to shared resources like caches.

### Azure (Confidential VMs, Titan Chips):
Azure’s Titan Chips provide a hardware root of trust, and Confidential VMs offer encrypted memory to secure workloads. However, a compromised hypervisor could still attempt timing attacks by manipulating CPU clock rates or monitoring cache behavior.

### Google Cloud (Compute Engine):
GCP provides strong isolation between virtual machines but could still be at risk from timing or performance manipulation if an attacker gains hypervisor-level access.

### OpenStack:
In OpenStack environments, security relies on the configuration of the hypervisor (typically KVM) and resource isolation. If misconfigured, OpenStack instances could be susceptible to single-stepping or timing-based attacks.

---

## Attack Vectors:
- **Hypervisor Compromise**: An attacker could manipulate CPU timing and extract sensitive information from the execution of workloads.
- **Cache-Timing Attacks**: Manipulating or observing cache timing could allow attackers to infer sensitive data.

---

## Mitigations:

### AWS Mitigations:
1. **Use Nitro Enclaves for Isolation**:  
   Nitro Enclaves provide strong isolation for sensitive workloads, ensuring that resources are dedicated and not shared across instances. This reduces the risk of timing attacks.  
   - **Documentation**: [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/)

2. **Disable Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT)**:  
   Disable SMT on sensitive instances, especially when processing cryptographic material, to prevent side-channel attacks via shared cores.  
   - **Documentation**: [AWS SMT Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html)

3. **Monitor CPU Throttling and Burstable Instances**:  
   Monitor **CPU credit balance** and **throttling** in burstable instances (e.g., T3, T4g) to prevent potential attacks that rely on CPU sharing.  
   - **Documentation**: [Monitor EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring_ec2.html)

### Azure Mitigations:
1. **Use Confidential VMs**:  
   Deploy sensitive workloads on Azure Confidential VMs, which use encrypted memory and offer a high level of isolation.  
   - **Documentation**: [Azure Confidential Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/)

2. **Leverage Microsoft Titan for Hardware Root of Trust**:  
   Titan chips help ensure secure boot and the integrity of cryptographic operations. Ensure that workloads requiring high security leverage Titan-protected instances.  
   - **Documentation**: [Microsoft Titan Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/tpm-overview)

3. **Monitor Performance and Latency Anomalies**:  
   Use Azure Monitor to detect spikes in CPU usage, context switches, or increased latency that could indicate a timing or single-stepping attack.  
   - **Documentation**: [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/)

### Google Cloud Mitigations:
1. **Use Sole-Tenant Nodes for Isolation**:  
   In GCP, deploy sensitive workloads on **sole-tenant nodes**, which ensure that no other tenants are running on the same hardware, reducing the risk of timing-based attacks.  
   - **Documentation**: [Sole-Tenant Nodes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/sole-tenant-nodes)

2. **Monitor CPU and Memory Performance**:  
   Set up **Stackdriver Monitoring** (now part of Google Cloud Operations) to watch for performance anomalies such as unexpected CPU or memory spikes, which could signal a potential attack.  
   - **Documentation**: [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations)

3. **Use Shielded VMs**:  
   Enable **Shielded VMs** to ensure secure boot and prevent unauthorized changes to your instance's firmware.  
   - **Documentation**: [Shielded VMs](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)

### OpenStack Mitigations:
1. **Disable SMT in the Hypervisor**:  
   Ensure that **Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT)** is disabled at the hypervisor level (e.g., KVM) to prevent shared core vulnerabilities in multi-tenant environments.

2. **Isolate Sensitive Workloads**:  
   Use **dedicated compute nodes** for sensitive workloads in OpenStack, ensuring that no shared CPU resources are available for other tenants.

3. **Monitor CPU Performance**:  
   Integrate OpenStack telemetry with tools like **Prometheus** or **Nagios** to monitor CPU performance, context switches, and resource contention. Custom alerts can be set for abnormal patterns that might signal timing attacks.

4. **Secure Hypervisor Configuration**:  
   Implement strict hypervisor configuration rules to prevent unauthorized access or misconfigurations that could expose instances to CPU manipulation attacks.

## Detection Strategies:

### AWS Detection:
1. **Monitor with CloudWatch Anomaly Detection**:  
   Use **CloudWatch Anomaly Detection** to identify irregularities in CPU usage, context switching, or resource contention. Set up custom alarms for threshold breaches.  
   - **Documentation**: [CloudWatch Anomaly Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Anomaly-Detection.html)

2. **Track Performance with Lookout for Metrics**:  
   AWS **Lookout for Metrics** can help detect performance anomalies related to CPU and latency by automatically monitoring CloudWatch metrics using machine learning.  
   - **Documentation**: [Lookout for Metrics](https://aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-metrics/)

### Azure Detection:
1. **Monitor Anomalies with Azure Monitor**:  
   Use **Azure Monitor** to track unusual spikes in CPU, memory, or disk I/O that may indicate timing or single-stepping attacks.  
   - **Documentation**: [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/)

2. **Leverage Azure Sentinel for Threat Detection**:  
   Integrate **Azure Sentinel** to detect and respond to security anomalies, including unusual CPU or system behavior.  
   - **Documentation**: [Azure Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/)

### Google Cloud Detection:
1. **Use Stackdriver for Monitoring**:  
   Set up custom alerts in **Stackdriver Monitoring** to watch for anomalous CPU activity, including spikes or unexpected throttling behavior.  
   - **Documentation**: [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations)

2. **Audit Shielded VM Logs**:  
   Continuously audit **Shielded VM** logs to ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made to the instance’s firmware or boot processes.  
   - **Documentation**: [Audit Shielded VMs](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)

### OpenStack Detection:
1. **Monitor with OpenStack Telemetry (Ceilometer)**:  
   Use **Ceilometer** or external monitoring tools like **Prometheus** to track CPU performance, context switches, and hypervisor resource usage.
  
2. **Set Alerts for Anomalous CPU Usage**:  
   Implement alerts using tools like **Nagios** or **Zabbix** to detect abnormal CPU cycles, resource contention, or excessive context switching.
