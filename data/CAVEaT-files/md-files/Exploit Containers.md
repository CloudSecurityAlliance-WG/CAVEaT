 Exploiting Containers (version 1.0) 
 
Cloud Service Label: PaaS, SaaS, IaaS 
 
Docker containers utilized in the cloud can be exploited by an adversary. Azure 
manages containers via Azure Container Services (ACS) and Amazon manages 
containers via Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Depending on how 
the infrastructure is pr ovisioned, exploiting this could provide privilege escalation, 
discovery, and exfiltration opportunities. 
 
Examples 
Name Description 
DEF CON 27: Cloud Village Presentation If docker.sock (which is normally open on port 2376) is 
exposed and you can interact with it, you can create a 
new container and mount the host’s filesystem (as root), 
run the container, and the adversary can have root 
privileges to the filesystem. BOtB, i s an open source 
tool created to automate recon and exploit of 
containers. 
Exposed Docker Port Identifying an open port associated with Docker (2376 
is the most common open port by default) can lead to 
finding running containers and images. Most containers 
run with default root privileges, so running docker -H 
192.168.1.7:2376 exec -it  /bin/bash 
will automatically give you root once logged in. 
 
Mitigations 
Mitigation Description 
Restrict Access to Specific Networks Restricting the access that Containers have to specific 
networks will limit the availability of data if credentials 
are compromised. 
Limit Access to Accounts A user or process with read privileges to a registry also 
has the ability to list and pull any images in a registry. 
Make sure only those that need privileges have it. 
Disable Unnecessary Ports and Services 
 Ensure ports and services that are publicly accessible 
are locked down and disabled if necessary. In the case 
of Docker, port 2376 is the ssl version of Dockerd 
socket should not be open to the Internet.

 Detection 
This can be detected by monitoring the commands being run through the cloud API. 
Most users/processes should not be listing and pulling images in a registry. If this 
happens it should be investigated. Any type of suspicious account activity should be 
monit ored and flagged. This can include unusual log on times, connecting from 
unexpected devices, password changes, as well as multiple log on attempts. 
Detection Description 
Create Log Metric Filters and Alarms for AWS To create a metric filter and alarm: 
1. Create a metric filter that checks for IAM policy 
changes and the  
2. Create an SNS topic 
3. Create an SNS subscription to the above topic 
4. Create an alarm associated with the filter and SNS 
topic created in steps 1 and 2 respectively 
Monitor Activity in AWS Account Various services in AWS offer logging features that allow for 
detection capabilities. These include CloudFront, CloudTrail, 
CloudWatch, Config, and S3. 
Monitor for Suspicious Activity in Azure Azure AD can generate anomaly reports than can be run on 
a daily basis. Azure AD Identity Protection show current risks 
in its dashboard and provides daily email summary 
notifications. Policies can also be configured to alert to 
specific issues. 
Create Log Metric Filters and Alarms for CloudTrail To create a metric filter and alarm: 
1. Create a filter that checks for CloudTrail changes 
and the specific  
2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify 
3. Create an SNS subscription to the above topic 
4. Create an alarm associated with the filter from 
step 1 and SNS topic in step 2 
Create Activity Log Alerts in Azure To create log activity alerts for deletion in the Azure 
Console: 
1. Navigate to Monitor’ / ‘Alerts 
2. Select Manage alert rules 
3. Click on the Alert Name where Condition contains 
operationName equals 
Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securit
yRules/delete 
4. Hover a mouse over Condition to ensure it is set to 
Whenever the Administrative Activity Log “Delete 
Security Rule 
(networkSecurityGroups/securityRules)” has “any” 
level with “any” status and event is initiated by 
“any” 
Create, View, and Manage Activity Alerts in Azure Monitor To create a log alert in the Azure portal: 
1. Select Monitor -> Alerts 
2. Select New alert rule of the Alerts window 
3. Provide information in Define alert condition 
4. Provide details in Define alert details

 5. Specify action group for new alert rule under 
Action group , or create a new action group with + 
New group 
6. Select Yes for the Enable rule upon creation 
option 
7. Select Create alert rule 
 
To view and manage alerts: 
1. Select Monitor -> Alerts -> Manage alert rules 
2. Select the rule you want to modify and double -
click to edit the rule options 
3. Click Save 
Azure Resource Manager Templates Azure Resource Manager templates in the format of JSON 
files that can be used to configure metric alerts in Azure 
Monitor. These templates can be used for simple static and 
dynamic threshold metric alerts, availability tests, and 
monitoring multiple resour ces. 
Enable CloudTrail across all regions in AWS To enable CloudTrail across all regions: 
1. Sign into the AWS Management Console and open 
the CloudTrail console 
2. Click on Trails 
3. Set necessary Trails to All option in the I column 
4. Click on a trail via the link Name column 
5. Set Logging to ON 
6. Set Apply trail to all regions to Yes 
Configure log profile to capture activity logs for all regions in 
Azure To set up activity logs for all regions: 
1. Navigate to Azure console 
2. Go to Activity log 
3. Select Export 
4. Select Subscription 
5. Check Select all in Regions 
6. Select Save
