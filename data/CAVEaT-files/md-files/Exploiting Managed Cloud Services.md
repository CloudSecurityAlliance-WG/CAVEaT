 Exploiting New Vulnerabilities in Managed 
Cloud Services (version 1.0) 
 
Cloud Service Label: PaaS, SaaS 
 
Description 
Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have various services within their cloud environments 
that can be seamlessly integrated and utilized for a customer’s needs. The purpose of 
managed cloud services is to remove the need to install and manage common software 
applications. These managed services move the responsibility of maintaining, patching, 
and updating to the CSPs and the vendors that provide the managed service. 
 
Managed cloud services can be used at both the infrastructure and application levels. 
The infrastructure level includes services for providing architecture recommendations, 
system administration, monitoring, DNS management, Kubernetes support and many 
others. The application level provides support for packages like Ansible, Elasticsearch, 
LogStash, database management with MongoDB, and various other services as well. 
 
While managed cloud services are generally thought to be more secure than running a 
custom or IaaS hosted application or tool, they are still susceptible to vulnerabilities and 
exploitation and often provide less visibility to customers than comparable Iaa S-hosted 
versions. The Cloud Service Provider will normally remove the worry of vulnerability 
management through automatic patching and updating, but it is still important to be 
aware of potential vulnerabilities through managed cloud services, because the se could 
still lead to exploitation of customer assets. 
 
Examples 
Name   Description   
Azure Sphere Talos Vulnerabilities A blog article put out by Talos Intelligence highlights several vulnerabilities 
found in the Azure Sphere service, which is a cloud System on a Chip 
(SoC) platform designed to implement IoT application security. These 
vulnerabilities include information di sclosure, unsigned code execution, 
socket memory corruption, denial of service, and privilege escalation. 
 
 
Mitigations 
Mitigations Description 
Audit 
 Perform periodic audits to ensure that best security practices are 
implemented and that unusual /unexplainable events are not occurring 
 AWS To perform an audit via AWS it is suggested to review information such as 
account details (credentials, users, groups, roles, etc), mobile 
applications, EC2 configurations, policies, and account activity. How to 
audit these different factors can be found i n detail at: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws -security -audit -
guide.html .

 Azure To perform an audit via Azure an administrator can review the audit logs 
that are recorded under Azure’s monitoring for active directory. The audit 
logs allow for filtering, as well as looking at users, groups, and enterprise 
specific information. Full det ails on how to access this information can be 
found at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en -us/azure/active -
directory/reports -monitoring/concept -audit -logs. 
 GCP To perform an audit via GCP the logs can be reviewed. GCP breaks this 
down into three categories; admin activity, data access, and system 
events. The audit logs can be viewed a few different ways - the console, 
API, or gcloud. Full details on how to view th ese logs, how to export, and 
for how to configure the retention period can be found here: 
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit . 
Setting IAM Policies 
and Permissions Implement least privilege and assign roles and permissions to users as 
necessary. 
 AWS Amazon’s article for IAM security best practices in AWS covers topics 
including creating individual IAM users, using AWS managed policies, 
roles, frequent key rotation and others. Full details can be found at 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best -
practices.html . 
 Azure Microsoft’s article for IAM security best practices in Azure covers topics 
including centralizing identity management, turning on conditional access, 
use role -based access control, using Azure AD for storage authentication, 
and others. Full details can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en -
us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity -management -best-practices . 
 
 
Detection 
Detection Description   
Leverage IDS Rules to independently detect unusual 
network events within the cloud Implementing Snort rules 54501 – 53504 will detect 
attempts at exploitations specific to the above Azure 
Sphere vulnerabilities. 
Configure log profile to capture activity logs for all regions 
in Azure To set up activity logs for all regions: 
1. Navigate to Azure console 
2. Go to Activity log 
3. Select Export 
4. Select Subscription 
5. Check Select all in Regions 
6. Select Save 
Enable CloudTrail across all regions in AWS To enable CloudTrail across all regions: 
1. Sign into the AWS Management Console and 
open the CloudTrail console 
2. Click on Trails 
3. Set necessary Trails to All option in the I column 
4. Click on a trail via the link Name column 
5. Set Logging to ON 
6. Set Apply trail to all regions to Yes 
Monitoring for Regional Activity Tools like Splunk or even CloudSploit have the ability to 
alert based on region and ingest CloudTrail logs. In 
CloudSploit, a plugin called EC2 Max Count can be 
configured to alert after a certain threshold of EC2 
instances is met. Real -Time Events service is another

 feature of CloudSploit that allows alerts for activity in 
unused regions.
