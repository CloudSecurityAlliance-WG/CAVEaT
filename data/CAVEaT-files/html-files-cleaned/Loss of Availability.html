<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may attempt to disrupt essential components or systems to prevent the delivering of IT services. Adversaries may leverage native Cloud API functionality to delete resources such as VMs, storage accounts or data bases. They can also use native portal capabilities to remove access accounts’ ability to control Cloud resources. As Amazon and Azure offer more edge integrated services, this disruption could also affect physical device operation and sensor collections.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="312"><p>As pointed out in a research papers written by the University of California San Diego, WPI and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, co-residence is the process of identifying cloud instances that share the same underlying physical infrastructure, despite being separated virtually. Once virtual machine co-residence has been identified it may be possible to attempt to exhaust resources of the physical host to degrade the performance of other clients VM on the host</p>

<td valign="top" width="312"><p>To have a data backup in an AWS environment, AWS Backup can be used. This is a way to centralize and automate backup services, as well as enforce backup policies that might include aspects such as encryption requirements and audit the activity on the backup. The backup service is PCI and ISO compliant and is HIPAA eligible. There are different backups available: cloud-native (across all AWS services) and hybrid (across AWS and on premise data). To accomplish this a backup plan needs to be created that defines criteria on how to manage the backups (ie. how frequently to backup, how long to keep the backups, etc.), then the resources to backup are assigned. Once the resources are backed up they can be minored, modified, or restored. To get started with this information can be found here:<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/backup/getting-started/"><b>https://aws.amazon.com/backup/getting-started/</b></a><b>.</b>For more information on the service refer here:<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/backup/"><b>https://aws.amazon.com/backup/</b></a><b>.</b>Access to and introduction video can be found here:<a href="https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=29646"><b>https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=29646</b></a><b>.</b></p>

<td valign="top" width="312"><p>To have a data backup in an Azure environment, Azure Backup service can be used. This allows for on-premises, Azure VMs, Azure file shares, SQL server in Azure VMs, and SAP HANA databases in Azure VMs to be backed up. There are multiple ways this can be accomplished; through the portal, PowerShell, CLI, and ARM template. From the portal a VM to be backed up can be selected, then enable to backup resource, start the backup job, monitor the backup job, and when you no longer need the deployment it can then be cleared up. Using PowerShell and CLI has the same steps (just accomplished through different commands) first a recovery service vault will be created, then the backup will need to be enabled for the service being backed up, then the backup job will need to be started, then monitored, and lastly clean up the deployment. Lastly, to deploy with the ARM template first the template has to be reviewed and edited as needed, then deploy the template, then the deployment must be validated by starting a backup job, monitoring it, and cleaning up the resources.</p>
<p>On this page multiple tutorials can be found for backing up specific resources:<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-vm-at-scale"><b>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/tutorial-backup-vm-at-scale</b></a>.
