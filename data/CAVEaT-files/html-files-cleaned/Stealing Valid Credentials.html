<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may steal the credentials of cloud administrators using well-known endpoint credential harvesting techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available cloud services, such as cloud storage services. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific cloud systems or resources.</p>
<p>It is common for adversaries to utilize stolen private keys, to legitimately connect to remote IaaS environments via<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021">Remote Services</a>. AWS routinely assigns remote keys to every new VM created. These keys are usually downloaded and stored on the local box of the user who is performing the VM creation task. A local exploit of this user’s workstation now also compromises access to whatever VM’s this user has created.</p>
<p>Local web browsers of cloud admin console users cache access tokens that enable quick reconnection if a browser window is accidentally closed. However these tokens may also be stolen from local machines to grant cloud console access to adversaries who have a presence on the local workstation of that user.</p>
<p>The overlap of local workstation access, credentials, and permissions across a network of local workstations and Cloud systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., user plane to control plane) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.</p>

This can be done multiple ways including the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI (Command Line Interface). Depending on the method used to implement this the procedure can vary, but will include the need to create a security group, create a network security group, associate that network security group with a specific subnet and then create security rules that are associated to the inbound and outbound rules for that subnet.

</td>
<td valign="top" width="459"><p>For IaaS Windows server VM’s, audit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. Use RBAC to limit the impact anyone account can have on your cloud assets. General “GOD” level accounts that have access to all cloud resources should never be used for daily administration within the cloud. Rather use accounts that have been delegated admin access to certain resources. In Azure for example, using an account with the owner role at the subscription level for every day tasks is a risky proposition. Once the infrastructure has been created and refined these credentials are no longer required for most admin tasks. Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent access if account credentials are obtained.</p>

<td valign="top" width="459"><p>To manage the access that privileged accounts have on the AWS cloud system to only allow administrators to perform administrative tasks on such accounts can be accomplished utilizing limited IAM administrator accounts. To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account the IAM limited administrator would be used. This is done by creating a policy that gives a user admin rights, but disallows the other actions using the AWS command line interface.
