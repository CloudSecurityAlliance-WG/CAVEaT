<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Cloud storage repositories like Azure containers and AWS S3 buckets are really convenient places to store code for use by developers who are developing apps within the cloud. They can be also serve out content via HTTPS to allow public consumption of new code. Although often intended as a temporary solution while working on more challenging aspects of code development, storing code in cloud storage can unintentionally be incorporated into production, leaving consumers of this software vulnerable to code modification when a container or bucket is misconfigured. Adversaries can modify code stored in buckets to implant backdoor software to gain a foothold in what would otherwise be a well-protected enclave. If a storage bucket used for hosting code is ever deleted in the future, adversaries can reclaim the bucket name and without any special privileges stage code for unsuspecting people to invoke. This is especially problematic if web servers are pointing at the repo to fetch some forgotten piece of code.</p>

<td valign="top" width="312"><p>The Rocket Chat install application was grabbing code from a publicly accessible S3 bucket. When the S3 bucket was deleted, this made the situation even worse. Once a bucket is deleted, anyone with access to AWS can create a bucket of the same name. In this case putting a malicious script within the bucket and waiting for unsuspecting users of the Rocket Chat installation script to fetch and run their payload.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="409"><p>To encrypt data at rest in an Azure environment it can be done differently depending on the cloud service the customer is utilizing. For SaaS customers this can be enabled or available on each specific service. For PaaS customers there are specific storage and application platforms that can be used. In terms of IaaS customers this can be broken down to a couple different aspects. Encrypted storage can be enabled the same as PaaS services, utilizing other Azure services. Encrypted compute allows for all managed disks, snapshots, and images to be encrypted utilizing a service managed key. The keys are stored in the Azure key vault.

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Monitor for unusual queries to the cloud provider's storage service. Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set that is allowing access to data. Audit storage locations for executable files frequently.</p>
