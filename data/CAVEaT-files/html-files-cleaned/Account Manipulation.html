<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to subvert password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.</p>

<p><i>Azure AD</i></p>
<p>In Azure, an adversary can set a password for Service Principals, which is an application specific method of accessing Azure resources. This could facilitate persistence to all Azure services the SP has access to without using an actual userâ€™s credentials. Azure also allows alternative authentication mechanisms such as SAS tokens and certificates to be created and used rather than passwords for Azure services.</p>

<p><i>AWS</i></p>
<p>AWS policies allow trust between user accounts in different AWS accounts by simply identifying an external Amazon account ID and assigning it to a native role within the existing AWS account. It is then up to the cloud admin to notice that this has happened and that the role assigned to the trusted account is permissible.</p>

This can be enforced by first creating a policy that would prohibit actions except those that allow a user to change their password or manage 2FA, then attaching a policy to a group that includes all user accounts where they can be allowed all access if they sign in with 2FA. Once these actions are completed it should be tested to verify the access is given correctly.

Make sure once the policy is created and added to users that it is then being enforced, once enforced it should be tested for verification.

In the case of Azure, multiple subscriptions can be created with different administrators that can only access resources within the subscription. The subscriptions can still belong under the same Azure account for overall accounting and administration/policy.</p>

<td valign="top" width="417"><p>To manage the access that privileged accounts have on the AWS cloud system to only allow administrators to perform administrative tasks on such accounts can be accomplished utilizing limited IAM administrator accounts. To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account the IAM limited administrator would be used. This is done by creating a policy that gives a user admin rights, but disallows the other actions using the AWS command line interface.

To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account pre-defined administrator accounts can be used (mobile admin, Google voice admin, help desk admin, etc.). These accounts can be used with their pre-defined settings, or modified depending on specific use cases. These can limit access to basic functionality needed.
