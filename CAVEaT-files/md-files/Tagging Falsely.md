 Tagging Falsely (version 1.0) 
 
Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS 
 
Description 
AWS and Azure allow cloud users to tag resources with arbitrary labels ostensibly for 
accounting and management purposes. It is often a good practice to use this tagging 
information in detection engines and in making automated security decisions. If an 
adversary is able to discern the tagging protocol, he can alter tags for newly created 
services to potentially avoid detection or to circumvent security mitigations.

Mitigation Description 
Limit Rights to Add or Modify Tags 
 Azure does not currently allow you to limit tagging of a 
resource you already have contributor or owner rights 
to. However changes to the tags will be reflected in API 
logs in both AWS and Azure. 
 
Detection 
Tag results are recorded in Cloud API logs. Multiple concurrent tag changes that are not 
part of some CI/CD process are likely rare and should be viewed with suspicion
