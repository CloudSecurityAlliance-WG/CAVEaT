<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The cloud admin portal/API is accessible from any place in the world. By design, all Azure and AWS resources are theoretically accessible from this universal interface. Only identity credentials stand in the way of anyone accessing anyone else’s resources and information. The circumstance is not much improved for unclassified government only clouds, which also widely expose their portal and API and again rely on credentials to arbitrate access.</p>

<p>An adversary may use a portal with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.</p>

<p>Passwords to gain access to the portal/API can be stolen from administrator or privileged user workstations that interact with the portal/API through traditional harvesting techniques like spear phishing. 2FA greatly reduces the chance that such attacks will work. However even with 2FA, it may be possible for adversaries to use the token obtained after 2FA authentication for some brief period of time to gain access to your resources, if they have access to the machine that was granted access by 2FA. Within AWS, other accounts without 2FA may still be granted access to some or all of your resources through IAM roles. The portal/APIs themselves are complex web applications that change constantly. As such they may have intermittent security flaws that enable adversaries to by-pass the credential process and gain access to your resources.</p>
