<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may access data objects from improperly secured cloud storage.</p>
<p>Many cloud service providers offer solutions for online data storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application. Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly using the cloud provider's APIs. Solution providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems.</p>
<p>Misconfiguration by end users is a common problem. There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured (typically by unintentionally allowing public access by unauthenticated users or overly-broad access by all users), allowing open access to credit cards, personally identifiable information, medical records, and other sensitive information. Adversaries may also obtain leaked credentials in source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects that have access permission controls.</p>

<td valign="top" width="440"><p>To encrypt data at rest in an Azure environment it can be done differently depending on the cloud service the customer is utilizing. For SaaS customers this can be enabled or available on each specific service. For PaaS customers there are specific storage and application platforms that can be used. In terms of IaaS customers this can be broken down to a couple different aspects. Encrypted storage can be enabled the same as PaaS services, utilizing other Azure services. Encrypted compute allows for all managed disks, snapshots, and images to be encrypted utilizing a service managed key. The keys are stored in the Azure key vault.

This can be done multiple ways including the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI (Command Line Interface). Depending on the method used to implement this the procedure can vary, but will include the need to create a security group, create a network security group, associate that network security group with a specific subnet and then create security rules that are associated to the inbound and outbound rules for that subnet.

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Monitor for unusual queries to the cloud provider's storage service. Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set that is allowing access to data. Additionally, detecting failed attempts by a user for a certain object, followed by access to the same object may be an indication of suspicious activity.</p>
