<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>By default S3/Blobs are accessible from the public internet if the S3/blob identifier is known and you have the proper credentials. Given this, an adversary with stolen storage credentials can read from existing buckets from anywhere on the Internet and exfiltrate the data stored on them. Malicious actors with more expansive cloud access can stage collected data from other cloud assets within a bucket and then remove contents from the bucket to any external host. They can be also serve out content via HTTPS to allow public consumption of new code.</p>

<p>Although often intended as a temporary solution while working on more challenging aspects of code development, storing code in cloud storage can unintentionally be incorporated into production, leaving consumers of this software vulnerable to code modification when a container or bucket is misconfigured. Adversaries can modify code stored in buckets to implant backdoor software to gain a foothold in what would otherwise be a well-protected enclave. If a storage bucket used for hosting code is ever deleted in the future, adversaries can reclaim the bucket name and without any special privileges stage code for unsuspecting people to invoke. This is especially problematic if web servers are pointing at the repo to fetch some forgotten piece of code.</p>

For SaaS customers this can be enabled or available on each specific service. For PaaS customers there are specific storage and application platforms that are supported. In terms of IaaS customers Azure storage components such as queues and blobs are encrypted by selecting a check box during creation. Azure also allows customers to employ their own encryption in addition to the server side encryption provided by Azure –effectively creating two layers of encryption for all storage assets. Currently this must be done programtically as described here:<b>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic</b></p>
