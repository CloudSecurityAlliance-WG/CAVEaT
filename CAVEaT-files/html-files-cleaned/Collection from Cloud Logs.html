<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to use the cloud’s extensive logging capabilities, and the information written to them, as a way to gain information/access to a system. Ultimately, this can lead to the adversary gaining access to user data of a sensitive nature. Logging is essential for many aspects of day to day operations but logging of all information is not always necessary once a system is in production. Some types of log files that can be utilized are server log files, debugging logs, plugin logs, etc.</p>
<p>The Cloud depends on copious logging to make things more transparent to customers who no longer have access to underlying hardware and software layers. The cloud also enables these logs to be distributed to several different locations such as storage accounts, event queues, SIEMS, on premise repositories, etc. Cloud logs can be very informative, telling an adversary what assets are available and how they are protected. Sensitive data may also be exposed in these logs. In Azure for example, Key Vault secrets that would normally be very difficult to obtain may be logged in Logic function logs in the clear by default. The availability and integrity of logs is often stressed by security professionals. The confidentiality of these logs is often not given priority.</p>

<td valign="top" width="312"><p>Adversaries may exploit a vulnerability in com.gradle.plugin-publish versions prior to 0.11.0 where an author publishes a plugin where the build log is public and the –info flag is used. Under these circumstances the build log will contain an AWS pre-signed URL that would allow an adversary to access the pre-signed URL, of a plugin that was recently uploaded, and replace it with their own plugin.</p>
