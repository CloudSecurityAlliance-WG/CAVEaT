<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>An adversary may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups or snapshots of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.</p>
<p>A defender who is monitoring for large transfers external to the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider or even to another VPC illicitly created within the same account. Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.</p>
<p>Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.</p>

This can be done multiple ways including the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI (Command Line Interface). Depending on the method used to implement this the procedure can vary, but will include the need to create a security group, create a network security group, associate that network security group with a specific subnet and then create security rules that are associated to the inbound and outbound rules for that subnet. Full details on how to configure this utilizing the various methods can be found below:</p>

For instance minimum password length, require a range of characters (lowercase, uppercase, number, and non alphanumeric ), allow users to change their own password, password expiration, prevent password reuse, and require administrator reset after password expiration.

<td valign="top" width="408"><p>Good password practices can be enforced in Azure only with managed domains created using the resource manager deployment. By default these accounts have some policies enforced including amount of lockout duration, allowed number of logon attempts,Reset failed logon attempts count after 30 minutes, and lifetime of password. Other policies that can be changed are minimum password length and the ability to enforce the concept of ‘passwords must meet complexity requirements’. These configurations can be accomplished by accessing the Active Directory Administrative Center under administrative tools, then editing the rules under the settings for the Password Settings Container.
