<p>(version 1.0)</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may steal the credentials of cloud administrators using well-known credential harvesting techniques.</p>
<p>Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available cloud services, such as cloud storage services. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific cloud systems or resources. Harvested credentials can allow an adversary initial access, the ability to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, collect, and exfiltrate data.</p>

This can be done multiple ways including the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI (Command Line Interface). Depending on the method used to implement this the procedure can vary, but will include the need to create a security group, create a network security group, associate that network security group with a specific subnet and then create security rules that are associated to the inbound and outbound rules for that subnet. Full details on how to configure this utilizing the various methods can be found below:</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="443"><p>For IaaS Windows server VM’s, audit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. Use RBAC to limit the impact anyone account can have on your cloud assets. General “GOD” level accounts that have access to all cloud resources should never be used for daily administration within the cloud. Rather use accounts that have been delegated admin access to certain resources. In Azure for example, using an account with the owner role at the subscription level for everyday tasks is a risky proposition. Once the infrastructure has been created and refined these credentials are no longer required for most admin tasks. Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent access if account credentials are obtained.</p>

<td valign="top" width="443"><p>To manage the access that privileged accounts have on the AWS cloud system to only allow administrators to perform administrative tasks on such accounts can be accomplished utilizing limited IAM administrator accounts. To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account the IAM limited administrator would be used. This is done by creating a policy that gives a user admin rights, but disallows the other actions using the AWS command line interface.

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).</p>
<p>Perform regular audits of cloud accounts to detect accounts that may have been created by an adversary for persistence. Checks on these accounts could also include whether default accounts such as Guest have been activated. These audits should also include checks on any appliances and applications for default credentials, and if any are discovered, they should be updated immediately.</p>
