<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud security services running on a system after gaining initial access. These services can differ depending on if it's platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). Most security aspects of Cloud services are easily viewed and configured from the cloud service dashboard/portal. Even without the ability to change security settings, the ability to read the security configurations of network firewalls, monitoring agents, etc., enable a significantly greater opportunity to defeat these defenses.</p>

To limit the administrative account pre-defined administrator accounts can be used (mobile admin, Google voice admin, help desk admin, etc.). These accounts can be used with their pre-defined settings, or modified depending on specific use cases. These can limit access to basic functionality needed.
