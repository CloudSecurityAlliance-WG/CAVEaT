<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries with a sufficient level of access may create a local system, domain, or cloud tenant account. Such accounts may be used for persistence that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.</p>
<p>In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection. In Azure these are called Service Principal accounts.</p>

In the case of Azure, multiple subscriptions can be created with different administrators that can only access resources within the subscription.

To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account the IAM limited administrator would be used. This is done by creating a policy that gives a user admin rights, but disallows the other actions using the AWS command line interface.

To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account pre-defined administrator accounts can be used (mobile admin, Google voice admin, help desk admin, etc.). These accounts can be used with their pre-defined settings, or modified depending on specific use cases. These can limit access to basic functionality needed.
