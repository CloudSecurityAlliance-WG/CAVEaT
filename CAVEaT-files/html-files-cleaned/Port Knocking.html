<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Malicious rootkits on a host in the cloud still require a method of command and control to accomplish adversary objectives. If a compromised cloud host happens to be hosting a public web server or other publicly accessible network service, it is possible to secretly communicate with a rootkit that resides on this host by sending application packets to the service with carefully encoded source ports. In this way the traffic will pass through any firewalls or network security groups which are programmed to let port traffic destined to the service through. Once the packet is delivered to the cloud host, the rootkit can sniff the packet and interpret the source ports as directives.</p>

The audit logs can be viewed a few different ways- the console, API, or gcloud.

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Detecting the presence of port-knocking command and control might be possible based on an examination of simple network flow records. In the known exploit, source ports of packets were not increasing monotonically as is the custom from the same IP client. An inspection of flow records from the host would reveal odd behavior as the source ports of packets were jumping around and were both increasing and decreasing by huge amounts in short order.</p>
