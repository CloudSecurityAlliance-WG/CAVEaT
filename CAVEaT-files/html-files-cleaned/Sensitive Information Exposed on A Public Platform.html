<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to exploit information that is found exposed online. This type of information could include emails, usernames, passwords, keys, and any information considered sensitive that could be used to facilitate initial or prolonged access. Instances of this could include credentials uploaded to GitHub, information found on a server, or in numerous other places. Adversaries may be able to exploit sensitive information that is exposed. For this reason, configurations should be made to lock down any and all sensitive information and be vigilant when uploading information to publicly accessible resources. This can lead to initial access, privilege escalation, discovery, and collection.</p>
