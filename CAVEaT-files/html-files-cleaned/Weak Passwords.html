<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to exploit weak passwords to gain initial access. When user accounts utilize weak, or reused passwords, it runs the risk of adversaries gaining access, once access is gained, they can continue on in their attack. The adversary may have the ability to change user credentials locking the user out, collect data, maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally. The level of access, and ability for adversary to complete these tasks, is dependent on the permissions the user of the exploited password holds.</p>

In the case of Azure, multiple subscriptions can be created with different administrators that can only access resources within the subscription. The subscriptions can still belong under the same Azure account for overall accounting and administration/policy.</p>

<td valign="top" width="443"><p>To manage the access that privileged accounts have on the AWS cloud system to only allow administrators to perform administrative tasks on such accounts can be accomplished utilizing limited IAM administrator accounts. To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account the IAM limited administrator would be used. This is done by creating a policy that gives a user admin rights, but disallows the other actions using the AWS command line interface.

To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account the specific administrative needs can be picked from a number of options available (Azure DevOps Administrator, Billing Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, etc.) These different options can be edited to fit the needs and limit the basic access.

To configure this the administrator would have two accounts; one would have administrative rights and no basic access while the other account has basic access with no administrative rights. To limit the administrative account pre-defined administrator accounts can be used (mobile admin, Google voice admin, help desk admin, etc.). These accounts can be used with their pre-defined settings, or modified depending on specific use cases. These can limit access to basic functionality needed.

These configurations are for IAM accounts only and have a range of different characteristics that can be enforced. For instance minimum password length, require a range of characters (lowercase, uppercase, number, and non alphanumeric ), allow users to change their own password, password expiration, prevent password reuse, and require administrator reset after password expiration.

<td valign="top" width="443"><p>Good password practices can be enforced in Azure only with managed domains created using the resource manager deployment. By default these accounts have some policies enforced including amount of lockout duration, allowed number of logon attempts,Reset failed logon attempts count after 30 minutes, and lifetime of password. Other policies that can be changed are minimum password length and the ability to enforce the concept of ‘passwords must meet complexity requirements’. These configurations can be accomplished by accessing the Active Directory Administrative Center under administrative tools, then editing the rules under the settings for the Password Settings Container.

<p>Collect events that correlate with changes to account objects on systems and the domain, such as event ID 4738. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password.</p>
<p>Use of credentials may also occur at unusual times or to unusual systems or services and may correlate with other suspicious activity. Azure displays all sign-ins to AD under the Active Directory blade.</p>
