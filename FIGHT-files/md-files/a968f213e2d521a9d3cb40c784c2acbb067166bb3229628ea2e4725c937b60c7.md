Develop Capabilities: Operator Network
Summary
An adversary may create an operator network to facilitate applying techniques to a victim UE. Adversary may create a fully functional operator network such as a 5G core and false base station to exploit the user and/or UE. Creation of a false base station may not be sufficient in a 5G network to further the adversary’s objectives due to security improvements from earlier generations. The availability of open 5G core and RAN software and services make this viable for an adversary. The adversary, controlling the 5G network the UE attaches, via additional techniques, such as FGT1583.501, may redirect the UE or use [FGT1562.501}( https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT1562.501) to perform a downgrade attack to weaken end-to-end security. Techniques suchs as FGT5009 may also be utilized by the adversary to evade defenses.
